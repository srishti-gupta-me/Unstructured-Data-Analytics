Photo by @joelsartore | These two may look like domestic house cats, but they're actually a pair of Scottish wildcats that reside at Wildcat Haven in Scotland. Unlike most cats, the Scottish wildcat is a multihabitat hunterâ€”a behavior that evolved in response to severe deforestation in its home range. This carnivore plays a key role in controlling the numbers of prey animals such as rabbits, rats, hares, and other small animals. Today, the biggest threat to the species is hybridization with feral cats. In an attempt to prevent that, Wildcat Haven has secured over 1,000 square miles (2,500 sq km) of safe habitat for the Scottish wildcat by humanely trapping feral cats, neutering them, and releasing them. With the support of the local community, this work has been helping the Scottish wildcat to thrive over the last decade and efforts will continue on for years to come.
