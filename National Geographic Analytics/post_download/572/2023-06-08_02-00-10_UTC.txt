Photo by @joelsartore | Meet Teiku, a two-month-old jaguar cub that calls @zoodomrd, in the Dominican Republic, home. Jaguars are most similar in appearance to leopards, but there’s nothing you can confuse them with in the wild since no other big cats live in South America. The most distinctive feature of the jaguar is the shape of their spots, which resemble a certain sweet-smelling flower—the rose. To see more species featured in the Photo Ark, follow me @joelsartore. #PhotoArk
