Photo by @joelsartore | Red-flanked duikers like this one at the Los Angeles Zoo are one of the smallest species of antelope, measuring in at less than 15 inches tall and weighing no more than 31 pounds. Aside from their size, this species can be identified by the large preorbital glands on their snout, which form bulges in their cheeks. These glands produce a secretion that has multiple uses, including marking territory claimed by a single antelope or a mated pair.
