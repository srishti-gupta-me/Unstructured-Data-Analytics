Photo by @daviddoubilet | A vulnerable sea turtle hatchling hides from predators within a dense floating forest of sargassum seaweed off Cozumel, Mexico. This living canopy is critical nursery habitat for marine life, but when it washes onto shore in mass quantities it can become a deadly blanket, smothering turtle and seabird nests and turning away beach-bound tourists. Scientists indicate 2023 will be an unprecedented year, with vast amounts of seaweed accumulations in the "sargassum belt" of the North Atlantic carried by currents to the beaches of the Caribbean, southern U.S., and Mexico. The tangled labyrinth that's an oasis at sea is a costly environmental and economic consequence when it lands. Follow @DavidDoubilet to submerge into planet ocean. #WorldOceansDay
