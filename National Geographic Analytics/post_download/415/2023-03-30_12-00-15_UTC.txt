Photo by @maddiemcgarvey | In West Virginia's Monongahela National Forest, areas that were once surface-mined are getting a new lease. In a wetland created to support amphibian and bird life, a snag—a dead or dying tree—was placed to serve as habitat or a perch for songbirds. Approximately 900,000 acres (365,000 ha), the forest is also being restored with the state's iconic red spruce. For more views around America, follow @maddiemcgarvey.
