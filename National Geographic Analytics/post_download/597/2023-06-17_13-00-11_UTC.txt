Photo by @timlaman | The ocean is full of truly alien creatures. This is the aptly named flamboyant cuttlefish, just about 3 cm (an inch) long. I photographed it on a night dive in Triton Bay, West Papa, Indonesia. It's the only one of these rare little guys I've ever encountered in hundreds of dives on Indonesia's amazingly diverse coral reefs.
