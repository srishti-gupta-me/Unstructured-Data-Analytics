Photo by @paoloverzone | Ludovic Ferrière, the chief curator of the meteorite collection at the Natural History Museum Vienna (@nhmwien), holds a piece of the cosmic rock that fell in 1751 near Hrašćina, Croatia. At Emperor Franz I Stephan’s request, the meteorite was brought to Vienna and eventually, with the Tabor meteorite, became a foundational piece for the museum’s extensive collection, the oldest in the world. The Widmanstätten pattern on this slice is an arrangement of iron-nickel crystals unique to meteorites, revealed when a polished portion is etched with a nitric acid solution or by flame heating. The pattern is named after Alois von Widmanstätten, a Viennese scientist who discovered it in 1808 while experimenting on this particular specimen.
