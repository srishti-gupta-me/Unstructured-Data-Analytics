Photo by @joelsartore | Red foxes, like this one @greenwoodwildlife, are mostly solitary, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have a lot to say. There have been more than 25 different kinds of vocalizations observed in red foxes, which are used to communicate to individuals both nearby and far away. Researchers have also found that foxes have their own distinct voices, so individuals can be distinguished from one another. To see more species featured in the Photo Ark, follow me @joelsartore. #fox #animal #wildlife #photography #PhotoArk
