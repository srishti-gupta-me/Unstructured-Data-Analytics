The designation of the land as a national monument, confirmed to National Geographic this week by the White House, will prevent new uranium mines and protect historically significant tribal lands. The decision by @potus is the culmination of a lobbying effort by a dozen tribes who have historical ties to the site and advocated for its monument status. It will be called Baaj Nwaavio I’tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument—the Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument.

The site encompasses natural habitat for the critically endangered California condor and an important watershed for the Colorado River, which provides water to 40 million Americans. It’s also habitat for desert bighorn sheep, and birds including the threatened western yellow-billowed cuckoo and the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher.
