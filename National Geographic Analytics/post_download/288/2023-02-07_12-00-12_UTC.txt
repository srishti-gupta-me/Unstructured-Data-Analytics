Photo by @michaelchristopherbrown | When I first visited Linfen, in 2010, just minutes after walking out of the central train station I saw through the hazy air this overgrown government building. China’s environmental protection agency said the coal belt city had the worst air in the country. At the time, the World Bank reported that 16 of the 20 most polluted cities were in China. Since then, Linfen’s government has made some efforts to clean up the city, ordering pollution controls such as closing substandard mines, limiting the traffic of coal trucks, and the promoting gas over coal as a heating source. There is controversy around the amount of progress in combatting the pollution, including criticism from the Chinese state itself.
