Photo by Matthieu Paley @paleyphoto | We sat around the fire after a simple breakfast of chai and chapatis. Daula Sain then prepared himself for another long day‘s walk on a Sufi pilgrimage across the Baluchistan mountains in Pakistan. He stood so elegantly in front of me, playing with his scarf—it was one of these flowing moments that are a gift to the photographer. Head over to National Geographic's YouTube channel to watch a short documentary, “Lahooti,” focused on the journey of these pilgrims. For more insights into our world, follow along @paleyphoto.
