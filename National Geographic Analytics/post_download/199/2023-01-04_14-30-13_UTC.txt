Photo by @erikalarsen888 | Blue Springs Park in Central Florida is a winter haven for up to 800 manatees. From the visitorâ€™s walk around the park, tourists can view manatees for hours in this peaceful habitat because in the winter no one is allowed to swim or boat near the springs. This enables manatees to congregate in a quiet environment.
