Photo by @orsolyahaarberg | See that area that looks like white carpet in this aerial image of a mixed forest in Rondane, Norway? Itâ€™s a thick layer of lichen called Cladonia sp., which covers where the ground is most exposed. The Cladonia species do not tolerate thick snow cover, so they grow in places snow is blown away by wind in the winter. Nearby are autumn-yellow mountain birch (Betula pubescens) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). #FirstDayOfFall
