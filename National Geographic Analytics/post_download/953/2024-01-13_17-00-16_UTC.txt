Photo by Javier Aznar @javier_aznar_photography | A shield mantis (Choeradodis rhombicollis) stays in ambush pose over a leaf in Canandé, a forest in Ecuador protected by the nonprofit Fundación de Conservación Jocotoco. With a flat body that looks like a leaf, this formidable hunter waits, camouflaged among foliage of the same color, to launch a mortal attack on its prey.
