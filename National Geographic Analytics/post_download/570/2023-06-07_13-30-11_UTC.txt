Photo by Matthieu Paley @paleyphoto | Shadman Ali  is one of the many Sufi believers who undertake on foot a 180-kilometer (112 mi) annual pilgrimage under extreme heat across the desert and mountains of southern Pakistan. He keeps pigeons back home and took one of them on the road, which surprised me. “My pigeon will be blessed by the act of pilgrimage, as much as me,” he says. Head over to National Geographic's YouTube channel to watch a short doc titled “Lahooti,” focusing on the journey of these pilgrims. For more insights into our world, follow along @paleyphoto.
