Photo by @katieorlinsky | Caribou approach Arctic Village (Vashraii K’oo), Alaska, during their spring migration, when thousands of Arctic caribou from the Porcupine herd can be found moving near and through the community. The Neets’aii Gwich’in of Arctic Village lead a subsistence-based lifestyle that largely depends on caribou. The town is just south of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and community members have been vocal opponents of drilling in the refuge, particularly in the coastal plain, the birthing grounds for the Porcupine herd. Read more about caribou at the link in bio.
