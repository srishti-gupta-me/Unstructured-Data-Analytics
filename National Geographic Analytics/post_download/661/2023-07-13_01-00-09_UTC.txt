Photo by Orsolya Haarberg @fjellheimengalleri | Heavy wind sweeps freshly fallen snow between tracks left by wild reindeers in Norway’s Forollhogna National Park. The result: these amazing sculptures carved amid a wintry landscape. This image is part of my exhibition “REiN—Inspired by Nordic Nature,” on view in Vågå, Norway, this summer. Please follow @fjellheimengalleri for more images from the Scandinavian mountains.
