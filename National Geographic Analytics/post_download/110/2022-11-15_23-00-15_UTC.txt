Photo by @williamodaniels | In a gold mine in the Russian Far East, a leaky pipe created this frozen waterfall of muddy water, dusted with fresh snow. I took this photograph in 2015 for "Train for the Forgotten," a National Geographic story on remote places along the Baikal-Amur Magistral (BAM) railway, which crosses Siberia and the east for more than 4,000 kilometers (2,500 mi). Follow me on @williamodaniels for more stories.
