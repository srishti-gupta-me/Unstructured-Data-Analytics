Photo by @acacia.johnson | The port of Nome, Alaska, extends into the Bering Sea, and the loss of sea ice due to climate change could soon turn it into a major transport hub as the Arctic Ocean becomes increasingly navigable by ship. A planned expansion would make Nome the first deep-draft port (able to handle large ships) in the U.S. Arctic region.
