Photo by @martinedstrom | Kvikkjokk, a township in Sweden's Lapland region, has seen many changes over the years—and indeed continues to evolve. In the 17th century, the area was the domain of the Indigenous Sámi people, until prospectors found silver in the mountains and developed the area for mining, which was soon abandoned.
⁠
Today Kvikkjokk is a hub for Sámi communities working in the traditional reindeer trade. It's become a major tourism destination at the literal end of the road, a place where people jump off a bus or park their car to head into one of Europe's largest wilderness areas.
⁠
I've been here many times, heading to the Padjelanta and Sarek National Parks—the latter Europe's first such park—but I've never seen it as beautiful as on this morning. I captured this frame just as we were on a helicopter flying back from our wedding two summers ago.
