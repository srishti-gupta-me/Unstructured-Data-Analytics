Photo by @michaelchristopherbrown | Rangers at Virunga National Park headquarters in Rumangabo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, train two bloodhounds and a spaniel, both breeds essential in the battle to prevent poaching inside the park. In the right conditions, bloodhounds can trace a human scent up to ten kilometers (6 mi) and even for several days afterward. The spaniels are primarily used to trace weapons and ivory. Their caretakers are among the 700+ Virunga rangers, heroes risking their lives to protect endangered animals, such as the several hundred mountain gorillas who live there, in the name of conservation. More than 200 rangers have been killed in the line of duty.
