Photo by Keith Ladzinski @ladzinski | Hippos violently spar and thrash in the shallows of Kenya's Mara River. A fully grown male can weigh over 9,000 pounds (4,000 kg)â€”an extraordinary amount to throw around. They're notoriously temperamental and territorial, causing about 500 human casualties in Africa each year. To see more photos from this part of the world, please visit @ladzinski.
