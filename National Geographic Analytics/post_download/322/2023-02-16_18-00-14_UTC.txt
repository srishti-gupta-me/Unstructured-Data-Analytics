Photo by Reuben Wu @reuben | The harvest moon appears to hover above one of the giant turbines at Block Island Wind Farm, the first commercial offshore wind farm in the United States, operating since December 2016. 

By complete chance, the day of this shoot coincided with a full moon. Once I figured out what was possible, I was able to plan my exact location, altitude, helicopter flight time, and camera setup to make the perfect alignment. For more photos and stories, follow me @reuben.
