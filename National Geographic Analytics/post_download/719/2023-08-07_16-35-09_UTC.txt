Mounting evidence shows that more young adults are experiencing heart problems compared to decades past, and that worsening lifestyle habits—namely, poor diet and lack of exercise—are to blame. And some research suggests that COVID infections are adding insult to injury. Perhaps the most alarming trend is that, despite declines among older adults, the proportion of heart attacks among younger adults is increasing across the globe—which many doctors who spoke to National Geographic consider a public health emergency. Young adults are loosely defined as those between 20 to 50 years old.

Cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack—but "the really important thing for young individuals to know is that cardiovascular disease, for the most part, can be prevented if you take the right steps," says Ron Blankstein, senior preventive cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston. The AHA recommends following key measures that can improve and maintain your cardiovascular health. These include a healthy diet, regular physical activity, no tobacco smoking, and sufficient sleep, as well as managing your weight, cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure.
