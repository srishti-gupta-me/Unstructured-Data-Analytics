Photo by @danwintersphoto | David Blaine in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, July 23, 2023. Just a few months after he dislocated his shoulder in a nine story fall in front of a live audience in Las Vegas, a recovering David Blaine fulfills a decades-long dream of jumping off a bridge engulfed in flames as part of an episode of his new @natgeotv series “Beyond Belief with David Blaine” coming in 2024. In the series, David scours the world in search of extraordinary people—magicians, shamans, fakirs, and performers—who push themselves beyond what the world of medicine and science sees as possible. Brimming with thrill seekers and adventurists, and a vast array of extreme natural landscapes, David chose Rio de Janeiro for this extreme performance, a city full of dynamic energy and a daredevil spirit, as the place to make the jump. He connected with a champion high diver and worked with fire experts to prepare. It was fascinating to cover every aspect of this event and see all that it required to make sure it was successful. David has a true determination and a rare singular focus that surely is what allows him to be in a class of his own in pulling off these daring feats. Follow me @danwintersphoto for more adventures. #BeyondBeliefWithDavidBlaine
