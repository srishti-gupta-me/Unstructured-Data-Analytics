Photo by @Justin.Jin | Asia’s third longest river, the Mekong, is one of the world’s most fabled waterways thanks to the cultures and landscapes it runs through. I shot this picture of passengers exiting a water taxi while traveling in Laos, by kayak and bus, with my wife and kids. In few places on Earth do so many—an estimated 70 million people—depend on one river for so much. But this unique ecosystem faces collapse from overfishing, unsustainable development, and poor agricultural practices. Dams exacerbate the problem by disrupting flow and fish breeding.
