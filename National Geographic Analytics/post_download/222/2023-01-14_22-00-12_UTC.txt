Photo by Robbie Shone @shonephoto | Ice cones in Austria's Schwarzmooskogel cave used to be 15 stories high. Scientists are now racing to decipher the climate history stored in the ice before it melts into the surrounding pools. The eerie yellow glow seen in this photograph may result from light falling on soil-derived impurities in one ice cone.
