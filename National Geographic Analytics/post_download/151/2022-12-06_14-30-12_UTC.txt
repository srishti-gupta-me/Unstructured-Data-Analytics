Photo by @joelsartore | Few species love trees as much as two-toed sloths do. These sloths do everything in the trees, from eating and sleeping to mating and giving birth. While they will move from tree to tree, individuals rarely stray far from the general area where they were born, traveling no more than 120 feet (37 m) in a day. Trips to the ground are typically reserved for bathroom breaks, which happen only once a week. This one-month old was photographed @centroderescateamazonico.
