Photo by @jasperdoest | Gray seals (Halichoerus grypus) mate during the pupping season in winter. The hormonal changes in both male and female seals trigger mating. Once the nursing period is over, the females mate with a dominant male. Older males (around 10 years old) will compete with other males for “beach power,” often facing off against those just reaching maturity and possibly preventing them from mating that season. Not all males participate, though, as some may still mate depending on the size of the colony and other environmental factors. Follow @jasperdoest for more images of the wonders of nature.
