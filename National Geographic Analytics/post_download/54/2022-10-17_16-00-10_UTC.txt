Photo by Mattias A. Klum @mattiasklumofficial | A Galápagos land iguana has a favorite spiny meal on Isabela Island. Since freshwater is scarce on the Galápagos Islands, this gorgeous lizard obtains most of its moisture from the prickly pear that makes up a large proportion of its diet. It’s estimated that between 5,500 and 9,500 land iguanas are found in the Galápagos. On Santiago Island, when it was previously called King James Island, they were so abundant that naturalist Charles Darwin had remarked, “When we were left at James, we could not for some time find a spot free from their burrows on which to pitch our single tent.” In the years since, entire populations (including all the animals on Santiago Island) have been wiped out by introduced feral animals, such as goats, cats, and pigs.
