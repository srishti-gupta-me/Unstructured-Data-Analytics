Photo by @brianskerry | A newborn beluga whale "smiles" for the camera. It's part of a beluga population that winters near Greenland and migrates through the Northwest Passage of Canada in summer.

Seawater temperatures hover around minus two degrees Celsius (29 F), but freshwater from a river flowing into the ocean is about four degrees warmer, making this a perfect place to give birth and nurse calves.
