Photo by @nicholesobecki | A five-month-old camel, Baarud playfully tugs at Aadar Mohamed's hijab, in a coastal village in Somaliland. Baarud, which means "tough" in Somali, was given the name because its mother nearly died in a drought while it was in utero. To save her, Aadara divided her own meager rations and nursed the camel back to life. As the region once again endures a horrific drought–the worst in recorded history–it feels vital to reflect on the intimate connection among people, their animals, and the land. Read about the millions of migrant women like Aadara, whose lives have been upended by climate change, at the link in bio.
