The winds originate from high pressure over the Great Basin, a desert area encompassing six states. As wind is pulled toward the coast over and through the mountains, it leads to drier air and warms it through compressional heating. The end result: winds that can cause destructive wildfires. However, a wet winter, rainy summer, and likely upcoming El Ni√±o pattern collectively could mute fire activity, leading to a reprieve for a state with record-setting wildfires in recent years. 

This week the state is seeing a fall heatwave, leading to temperatures 15-degrees above normal, a hopefully tranquil reminder of the destructive weather patterns than can wreak havoc with wildfires in the state.
