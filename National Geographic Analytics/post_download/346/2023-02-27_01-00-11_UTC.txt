Photo by @richardbarnes | I have been photographing a National Geographic story on repatriation for the past 3 years. Repatriation concerns the return of objects mostly from European and American museums to the countries or peoples that originally produced them. Some of the artifacts were given under duress, and others were looted outright, but still others, such as the Nefertiti bust, now in the Neues Museum in Berlin, may have been obtained legally. It's no secret that colonial powers were rapacious in the theft of objects sacred to the people who created themâ€”from the Benin Bronzes looted in a British raid in 1897 to the Mandu Yenu throne, whose return the Bamun kings in Cameroon have been seeking for decades. It's a complicated and nuanced debate: Some former colonial powers, along with museums including the Smithsonian Institution, embrace return or transfer of control, and others justify their position by claiming that many of the objects in their collections would never have been preserved if it were not for a globe-trotting curator or colonial overlord who recognized their value and saved them from neglect or ruin. Nonetheless, I have witnessed a sea change since I started this project, with many museum directors, curators, and concerned government officials advocating for return in as conscientious and equitable a way as possible. It's never too late. Read the full story at the link in bio.
