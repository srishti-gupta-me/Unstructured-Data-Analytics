Photo by @bertiegregory | Despite being one of the most numerous fish groups on the planet, lantern fish are rarely seen—and thus little is known about them. They undertake a daily vertical migration: they come to the surface at night, returning to the deep during the day. Occasionally, for reasons we don’t understand, they get caught at the surface and a feeding frenzy develops. Photographed for my new show, now streaming on @disneyplus. #EpicAdventuresWithBertieGregory
