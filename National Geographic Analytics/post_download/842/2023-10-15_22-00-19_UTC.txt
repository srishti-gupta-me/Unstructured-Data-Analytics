The annual October event celebrates the state's Basque culture and history. While California may have a larger Basque population, Boise's community, estimated between 10,000-15,000, represents a greater concentration per capita in the United States. That number can swell to 25,000 during the festival, and the town knows how to host a party. Restaurants serve lamb chili, empanadas, and curry, to name a few dishes, while visitors watch performances by the Oinkari Basque Dancers, drink traditional ciders, and observe sheepherding. In the early 1800s, Basque immigrants were drawn here to find work as herdersâ€”and a path to citizenship. Their culture has permeated the region ever since.
