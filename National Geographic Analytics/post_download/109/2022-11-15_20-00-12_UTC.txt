Photo by @joelsartore | Lorises, like this greater slow loris, are the only existing venomous primate species in the world. Their venom is produced when secretions from a gland on their elbow mix with their saliva, which is then delivered into the bloodstream of their victims by razor-sharp teeth. The potent mixture, a form of protection against parasites and predators, can cause swelling, anaphylactic shock, and in some cases even death. Photo taken @mnzoo.
