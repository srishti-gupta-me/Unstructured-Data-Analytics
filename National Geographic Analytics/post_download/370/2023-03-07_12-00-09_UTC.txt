Photo by Tomas van Houtryve @tomasvh | Early on a cold winter morning in Paris, hundreds of paddle boarders on the Seine River pass next to Notre Dame Cathedral. The interior of Notre Dame has been closed to the public since a devastating fire in April 2019, but it's scheduled to reopen at the end of 2024.
