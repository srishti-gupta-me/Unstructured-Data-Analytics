Photo by @jasperdoest | After enduring a lifetime of abuse, Asian elephant Suzy has found refuge and a chance to be an elephant again. Her horrendous living conditions at the circus, which included malnutrition and a lack of medical care, resulting in blindness, have been replaced with a supportive and nurturing environment at the Elephant Conservation and Care Centre in Mathura, India. Now Suzy can feel what itâ€™s like to be free from the whip of a bullhook and enjoy long walks with her newfound elephant friend, Asha. Follow me @jasperdoest for more on the relationship between humankind and nature.
