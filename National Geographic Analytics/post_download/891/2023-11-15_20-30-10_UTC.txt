Photo by @joelsartore | Meet the mustached tamarin, a primate native to Brazil and Peru. While groups of mustached tamarins are highly territorial when they come in contact with one another, they are surprisingly willing to share territory with saddleback tamarins. Because of dietary differences, the two species do not compete for resources, allowing them to coexist and increase the odds of survival for both groups: The more individuals a group has, the greater the chances that someone will see or hear an approaching predator. 
This photo was taken at the Prague Zoo. To see more species featured in the Photo Ark, follow me, @joelsartore.
