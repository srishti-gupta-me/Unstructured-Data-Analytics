Photo by Charlie Hamilton James @chamiltonjames | Vultures feed on the carcass of a dead zebra on the plains of Tanzania's Serengeti National Park. The vulture's ugly appearance has purpose. The long, powerful necks of these Rüppell's griffon vultures are almost featherless—they have to reach into some pretty horrible places to feed and feathers would be a nuisance. Their bills are curved for tearing flesh and their tongues have backward-facing serrations to grip flesh and bring it into the mouth. Their personalities often confirm their grim demeanor; they're highly aggressive and make a disturbing rasping hiss. But when they're in the air, with wings spread to eight or so feet, they're as perfect a flier as any bird. In fact, the Rüppell's vulture holds the title of highest flying bird after one was once recorded at 37,000 feet (11,000 meters). 

I captured this shot with a remote-triggered camera placed inside the carcass. For more on that story, see the link in bio.
