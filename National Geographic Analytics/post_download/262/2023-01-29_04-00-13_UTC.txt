Photo by @joelsartore | Female acorn weevils use their long snouts, or rostra, to drill into a developing acorn from multiple angles, breaking up and softening the tissue inside before  boring into it once more to lay their eggs. The weevil larvae feed on the acorn as they develop. Photo taken at Waubonsie State Park in Iowa.
