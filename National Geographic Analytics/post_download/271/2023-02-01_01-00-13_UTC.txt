Photo by @luisadorr | This is Dani, a member of the ImillaSkate women's skateboarding collective in Cochabamba, Bolivia. As a child, she was introduced to the skating world by her brother. In 2019, after she graduated from university, she bought her first skateboard and dedicated herself to practicing.

The word imilla means “young girl” in Aymara and Quechua, and the group performs in the traditional attire—pollera skirts and hats (and hair in braids)—of the country's Indigenous highland women. Dani says that her great-grandmother wore polleras, and dressing in the same style is a point of pride. For the full story, check out the January issue or go to the link in bio.
