Photo by @Justin.Jin | Baobabs can live for thousands of years. But they're critically threatened by climate change, habitat encroachment, and the loss of animal species that spread the trees' seeds. Several species of the baobab can only be found in Madagascar. I was there to shoot a story about conservation in the country, one of Earth’s most biodiverse regions, when I passed these majestic giants amid a setting sun. True to their reputation, they have impressively unusual branches, called “roots raised in the sky.” Just before the sun approached the horizon, I dived into a bush and shot this image.
