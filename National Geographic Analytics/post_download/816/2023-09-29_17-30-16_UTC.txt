Photo by @beverlyjoubert | Much like other lion range states, Kenya grapples with a host of threats to its lion population. Yet the countryâ€™s vast wilderness areas remain critical strongholds for these most social of the big cats. The trials and tribulations of lion life that play out against this iconic backdrop have long been a source of inspiration for so many storytellers. From intricate family dynamics to fierce struggles for survival, it is easy to be captivated by lions. Our hope is that we can channel this enduring fascination into tangible action. It is urgently needed to ensure lions and their stories endure. To see more of my work, follow me @beverlyjoubert.
