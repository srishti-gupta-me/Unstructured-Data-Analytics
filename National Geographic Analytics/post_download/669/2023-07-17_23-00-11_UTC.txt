Photo by @jasperdoest | Elephant 126, as she's known, travels through the bustling streets of Kishangarh, India, but few seem to take notice. After the elephant was captured, she was subject to months of physical and mental abuse in order to be trained to perform at weddingsâ€”she's en route to one here. Though India's 1972 Wildlife Protection Act prohibits the renting of Asian elephants for commercial activities, the animal is still seen as a status symbol and these practices persist.
