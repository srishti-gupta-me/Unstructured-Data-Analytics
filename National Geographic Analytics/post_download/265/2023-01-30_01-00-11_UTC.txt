Photo by @bertiegregory | A mobula ray zooms into a school of lanternfish. These rays were previously thought to be passive filters only capable of feeding on microscopic plankton. We now know they regularly hunt small fish using the flaps on either side of their head, called cephalic lobes, to funnel fish into their huge mouths. Filmed for my new show now streaming on @disneyplus. #EpicAdventuresWithBertieGregory
