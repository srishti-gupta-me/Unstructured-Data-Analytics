Watching a cheetah pursue its prey across the plains of the Masai Mara in Kenya, you can clearly appreciate the design that makes this cat the champion of the high-speed chase: the long limbs, the sleek, lightweight build, the extreme maneuverability that allows it to dodge and weave as its prey makes a desperate escape. Yet no meal is ever guaranteed â€¦ and with so much energy expended on every hunt, each missed opportunity is a potentially costly setback.
