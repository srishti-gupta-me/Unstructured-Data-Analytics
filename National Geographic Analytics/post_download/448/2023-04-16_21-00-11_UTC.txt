Photo by Orsolya Haarberg @fjellheimengalleri | I was exploring the volcanic landscape around Leirhnjúkur, Iceland, when I came across these two male ptarmigans nestling in a blanket of snow. It was March, before ptarmigans return to their breeding grounds and take up their territories—so catching these two together was a lucky event that lasted until darkness came and I lost sight of the birds.
