Photo by @brianskerry | An Atlantic puffin brings back a butterfish to its chick on an island off the coast of Maine. Puffins typically feed their chicks long, slender-bodied fish such as sand lance, whiting, or herring, which the baby puffins can easily swallow. In recent years, the waters of the Gulf of Maine have been warming, resulting in fewer of these commonly found fish species. Puffin parents have had to hunt wide-bodied species like butterfish, which the chicks cannot swallow. Puffin chick mortality will increase as these trends continue. #GulfofMaine #ClimateChange
