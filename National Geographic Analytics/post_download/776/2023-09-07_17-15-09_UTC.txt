The astonishing discovery of four swords from nearly 2,000 years ago evokes ancient rebellions—and offers unprecedented opportunity for scientific investigation. These artifacts made of metal or organic materials like wood and leather rarely survive centuries of exposure to the elements—but the unique microclimate of what is now known as the Cave of Swords has preserved the iron blades intact with their sheaths, guards, and handles.
