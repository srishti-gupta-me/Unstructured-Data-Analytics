Photo by @macstonephoto | My first assignment for the magazine didn't start off well—I wasn't feeling well as I shot aerials out of a small plane over the Black River in North Carolina, and the next day we were grounded by dense fog. But on the third night, as my assistant, Zach Steinhauser, and I were making portraits of a bald cypress tree that took root in these sandy, tannic soils more than 2,600 years ago, I noticed streaking across the sky. It looked like a comet heading toward the moon. While screaming "What is that?!" I recomposed the frame and crossed my fingers. Completely bewildered and unsure of what we saw, we headed back to our tents to look up the news. Our minds were blown when we realized we had photographed the SpaceX Inspiration4, the first all-civilian flight into orbit—over one of the oldest cypress trees. As I always say, the swamp provides!
