Photo by @beverlyjoubert | There are plenty of hunting opportunities for a hungry lion in Botswana’s Okavango Delta … but finding them often involves a soggy trudge through the region’s famous swamplands. The lions here may have learned to navigate these inundated landscapes in search of prey, but venturing into the water is always a step outside of the comfort zone. With its sights set on a nearby lechwe–an antelope perfectly designed for the marshy life–this lion certainly has its work cut out.
