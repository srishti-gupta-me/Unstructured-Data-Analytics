Photo by @mattiasklumofficial | The king of bites! With a mind-boggling 3,700 pounds per square inch of bite force, crocodiles deliver a stronger crunch than lions. They simply leave the competition in the dust. This Nile crocodile, photographed in Selous, Tanzania, will eventually measure more than four meters (14 ft) long. Relative to their enormous size, it's no wonder their large and powerful jaws are among the world's deadliest traps. Visit me @mattiasklumofficial for more images.
