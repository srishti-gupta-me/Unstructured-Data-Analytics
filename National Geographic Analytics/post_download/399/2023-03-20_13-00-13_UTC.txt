Photo by @jasperdoest with Aaron Molloy | Arnold Camfferman, a 69-year-old skydiving instructor, is proof that it’s never too late to keep pursuing your dreams. Despite the widespread idea of slowing down as we age, Camfferman has completed more than 20,800 jumps and has no plans to stop anytime soon. As Harvard evolutionary biologist Daniel E. Lieberman explains, “Our genetic inheritance and history as humans require exercise and movement” to remain healthy into old age. Camfferman’s advice for a long and healthy life? “Never ever stop playing.” Read the full story at the link in bio and follow me @jasperdoest for more images about the science of longevity.
