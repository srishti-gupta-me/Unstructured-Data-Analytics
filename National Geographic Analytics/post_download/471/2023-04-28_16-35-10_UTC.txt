Photo by @stephenwilkes | In recent years, Old Faithful has drawn more than four million visitors from around the world to Yellowstone National Park, where they witness the geyser shoot steam as high as 180 feet (55 meters) into the air. Old Faithful’s reliable eruptions and the resemblance of its surrounding walkway to the curve of a clockface made it an ideal location to capture time changing from day to night. I wanted to shoot during a full moon, and as luck would have it the time of year allowed me to capture the sunrise and moonrise in one photograph. Granted special access to the Crow’s Nest atop the Old Faithful Inn, my assistants and I spent 30-plus hours photographing from this high yet intimate vantage point. In my “Day to Night” series, landscapes are portrayed from a fixed camera angle, capturing fleeting moments of nature as light passes in front of the lens over the course of a full day. A select group of these images are then blended into a single composite based on time. | For #NationalParkWeek, @GMC encourages you to explore and find your nowhere by visiting one of your local natural wonders.
