Photo by @franslanting | Tinted orange by the sun, a soaring dune is the backdrop for the hulks of camel thorn trees in Namibia's Namib-Naukluft Park. When this scene was published in the June 2011 issue as part of the feature story "Africa's Super Park," many thought it was a painting instead of a photograph. Others thought it had been altered in Photoshop. Nope. The photo shows sculptural tree skeletons on a clay pan backed by a sand dune—dotted with white grasses—glowing with early morning light. The magic moment came when the sun had illuminated the dune right down to the bottom while the clay pan was still in the shade. As a photographer I paint with light, and I look for unusual light that draws viewers into a scene. Follow me @franslanting for more images from the natural world.
