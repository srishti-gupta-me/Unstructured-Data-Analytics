Photo by @dina_litovsky | Mexico City is one of my favorite cities in the world. The densely populated metropolis, with over 21 million residents, is a cultural and artistic epicenter. I love walking its leafy avenues and numerous parks, which reveal an array of vignettes and glimpses into the lives of the people living in the capital. For more images, follow me @dina_litovsky.
