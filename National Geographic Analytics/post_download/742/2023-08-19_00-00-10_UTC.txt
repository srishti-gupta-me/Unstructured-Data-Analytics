Photo by Karine Aigner @kaigner | Few words can describe what it’s like to be on a platform high in the rainforest canopy, 80 feet (25 m) away from but at eye level with one of the world's most powerful raptors. Each morning before daylight I'd climb the tower’s narrow staircase, 90 feet (27.5 m) into the tree canopy. I’d set up my gear, take in the symphony of a slowly awakening rainforest, and spend the day, rain, shine, wind or hail (yes, HAIL!), atop the tower watching something most never lay eyes on: a harpy eagle family. For three days, mom, dad, and a tiny two-week-old chick went about their business of living. The air was sweltering, bees were interested in my lunch, sent up by pulley, and rains blasted through with little warning. As the tower swayed and the weather roiled, I made image after image. Harpia harpyja is one of the largest eagles—with a wingspan of 6.5 feet (some 2 m), rear talons up to 4 inches (10 cm) long, and a weight of 9-20 pounds (4-9kg). The female is twice the size of the male. This eagle is an elusive hunter, with legs as thick as human wrists. It feeds on sloths, howler monkeys, armadillos, baby deer, even peccaries. Not for a second was I scared … only blown away with respect for one of the most amazing raptors I’ve been privileged to spend time with. An eagle pair spends two years raising just one chick. The species is threatened by habitat loss and other human-related activity. Read about Brazilian researcher Everton Miranda's efforts to help save this eagle from extinction in the October 2020 issue. Follow @kaigner for more wildlife stories.
