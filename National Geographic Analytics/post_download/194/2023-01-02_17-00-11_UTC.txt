Photo by Reuben Wu @reuben | Svalbard is located so far north that you need to look south to view the northern lights. Enclosures that house and protect radar antennas, radomes at the Svalbard Satellite Station download data from polar orbiting satellites that monitor climate and improve warnings of potential weather disasters.
