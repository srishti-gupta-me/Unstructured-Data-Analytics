Allow me to introduce the true heavyweight viper of the planet: Bitis gabonica, most commonly known as the Gaboon viper, found in the rainforests and savannas of sub-Saharan Africa. This well-camouflaged beauty is not only the world's heaviest viper; it also has the longest fangs of all, up to 2 inches (5 cm), and on top of that, the highest venom yield of any venomous snake.

Scientists like my friend Zoltan Takacs study the genetic and molecular setup by collecting venom and DNA samples from these highly venomous vipers and their prey and predators. They are hopeful that the Gaboon viper may soon combat diseases. This will not affect the snakes in the wild at all, since snakes are released right after the examination and sampling. Gaboon vipers have a reputation for being slow moving and pretty cool around people. They usually hunt by ambush, often spending long periods motionless, waiting patiently for suitable prey to pass by.
