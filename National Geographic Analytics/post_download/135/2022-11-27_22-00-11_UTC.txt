Photo by @mattiasklumofficial | A painted dog chews on the bones of a young kudu in Botswanaâ€™s Mombo Camp. African painted dogs are very social, and packs frequently share food and assist ill or weak family members. Intricate social interactions are common, and the dogs communicate by touch, vocalizations, and actions. Painted dogs are endangered and faced with shrinking room to roam in their African home. They are also quite susceptible to diseases spread by domestic animals.
