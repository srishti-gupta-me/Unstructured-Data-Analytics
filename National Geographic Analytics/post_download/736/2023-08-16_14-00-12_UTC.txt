Photo by @nicholesobecki | Driving through a drought-stricken area of western Somaliland, I came across a group of women washing their clothes in a roadside puddle—the only water they could find. We spoke for a while of the challenges they faced, the animals they’d lost in the drought, and the wells that had dried up. Somalia has long been a place of extremes, but climate and environmental changes are compounding those problems and leading to the end of a way of life. As the women turned to walk home, I took this image of one of them in a field of cacti. The colors of her scarf melded into the vegetation and sky, and I was reminded of how intimate the ties are between people’s lives and the land. What we call our voice is profoundly shaped by the stories we see, hear, and internalize every day. They’re how we give shape to the world beyond our own limited experience. Stories can help guide our choices, and change us—sometimes radically. I hope images like these can reenforce our connection to the natural world and break down the false pride in our separateness that enables harmful behaviors toward our shared planet and one another.
