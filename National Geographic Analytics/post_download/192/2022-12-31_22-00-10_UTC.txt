Photo by @joelsartore | The crest atop the palm cockatoo’s head communicates its moods—down when relaxed, up when alert—and so does the color of its featherless cheeks. Normally red, they can turn pink or beige from stress or yellow with excitement. Photo taken @loroparque in Tenerife, one of Spain's Canary Islands.
