Since the first mail-delivery plane took off in 1924, small aircraft—capable of landing on short runways or on natural features such as tundra, glaciers, beaches, and water—have played a critical role in Alaska’s development. Today most of the state depends on aviation for essential transport between communities and to access remote wilderness areas. Flying is also part of Alaska’s culture: The state has six times more pilots per capita than any other in the United States. Follow me at @acacia.johnson for more stories from Alaska and beyond.
