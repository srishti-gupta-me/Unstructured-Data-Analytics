Photo by @babaktafreshi | The 52-foot-tall (16-meter-tall) Delicate Arch near Moab, Utah, is an icon of the U.S. Southwest and depicted on the state’s license plates. Here in Arches National Park, the desert becomes a rock wonderland and stars appear to touch the Earth. Located far from cities and streetlights, Arches is one my favorite dark-sky places. I started the 1.5-mile (2.4-kilometer) uphill hike in daytime and waited until the end of astronomical twilight for this single-exposure photograph of 15 seconds. Thousands of light-years beyond the arch, the core of our galaxy sets on planet Earth’s horizon. The Milky Way appears from the constellation Scorpius (bottom) to the Summer Triangle (top). | Adobe @Lightroom gives beginner and professional photographers easy tools to edit their photos, no matter where they are.
