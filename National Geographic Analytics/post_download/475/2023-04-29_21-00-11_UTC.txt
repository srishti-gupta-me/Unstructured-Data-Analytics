Photo by @joelsartore | Caribbean flamingos like this chick @indianapoliszoo initially hatch with white down feathers, and it will take several years (and many molts) before this hatchling sports its characteristic pink plumage. For the first few weeks of life, mom and dad are hands-on parents, but once a hatchling is able to walk and swim, it joins a group of its peers, known as a creche; it can have as many as 300,000 members! At this point, parents are still responsible for providing meals, but members of the creche are supervised and guarded by unrelated adults.
