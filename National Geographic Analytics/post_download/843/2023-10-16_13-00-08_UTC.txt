Photo by @joelsartore | With a back end that looks very much like an Oreo, this arachnid does not spin webs but instead burrowsâ€”using its hardened abdominal disc to plug the entry to its underground home. A member of the Cyclocosmia genus, these rare spiders are the smaller, less hairy cousins of tarantulas, and are often regarded as living fossils. To see more species featured in the Photo Ark follow me @joelsartore. #PhotoArk
