Photo by Sofia Jaramillo @sofia_jaramillo5 | Dropping temperatures and golden leaves in Wyoming's Tetons mean fall is here. As the nights get longer and cooler, the biological processes in leaves change as well. When plants grow in the spring, leaves appear green because of the chlorophyll that’s continually produced. With decreasing daylight at the end of summer, chlorophyll production slows and eventually stops, and red and orange pigments—carotenoids and anthocyanin—are revealed.
