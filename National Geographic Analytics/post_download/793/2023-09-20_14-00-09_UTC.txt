Photo by Christopher Gregory Rivera @cgregoryphoto | Ian Pagán Roig, the founder of a family farm in the northern mountains surrounding the town of Toa Alta, Puerto Rico, sees his role as a farmer as fundamentally political. For him, Puerto Rico is a place where feeding oneself from the land is a revolutionary act.

After Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States, in 1898, the newly imposed U.S. government transformed the island’s agricultural landscape, favoring large U.S. corporations and collapsing the local farming industry. Today Pagán Roig is part of a sustainable agriculture movement that’s helping a new generation of farmers restore plots of land to supplement food imports. His farm produces for markets but also hosts an education program, the Josco Bravo Project, that over the past nine years has minted 500 new farmers.
