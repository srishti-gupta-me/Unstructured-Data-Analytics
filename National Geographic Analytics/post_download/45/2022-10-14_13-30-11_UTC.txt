Photo by @BabakTafreshi | A bird flies toward the new moon and the city’s communication tower in the red dusk of Tehran. Most followers know me for my pictures of the night sky, but I can’t find beauty in the stars when my motherland is in pain. I was born in Iran in 1978 and lived there for 33 years. 
For me, this image is symbolic. In Iran the internet has been shut down to stop social media coverage of the current nationwide uprising. The unrest was triggered by 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died in police custody after being arrested for not wearing a proper head covering, in line with the country’s Islamic law. An estimated 80% of Iran’s 86 million people are usually connected to the web and active on social media despite strong internet censorship. International reporters are not allowed in Iran; the major news media rely on public phone footage. Iranian expatriates are trying to support the protesters by sharing their stories and organizing events worldwide.
