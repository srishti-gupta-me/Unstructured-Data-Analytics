Photo by @celestesloman | Dutch Holocaust survivor Jacques Grishaver sits for a portrait in Amsterdam for the premiere of “A Small Light.” As chairman of the Dutch Auschwitz Committee, a role he’s served since 1998, Grishaver led the initiative to set up the National Holocaust Names Memorial for those murdered by the Nazis during World War II, including 102,000 Dutch Jewish and 220 Sinti and Romany victims. The limited series “A Small Light” follows the story of Miep Gies, the young woman who helped hide Anne Frank and her family during the German occupation of the Netherlands.

New episodes of @asmalllight premiere Mondays 9/8c on National Geographic and stream Tuesdays on @hulu and @disneyplus. #JewishHeritageMonth
