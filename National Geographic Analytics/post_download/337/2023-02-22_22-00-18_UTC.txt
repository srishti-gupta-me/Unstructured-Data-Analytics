Photo by @luisadorr | Belén is the youngest member of ImillaSkate, a women's skateboarding group in Cochabamba, Bolivia.

A physiotherapy student, Belén would like to match her career choice to her passion. She started skateboarding 4 years ago because she was amazed by the balance skills and the level of difficulty of the maneuvers. She'd like to use her knowledge as a physiotherapist to help skateboarders.

"Imilla" means "girl" or "young lady" in Quechua and Aymara, the most widely spoken Native languages in Bolivia. 
“We want to motivate the female skateboarding scenario in Bolivia so this sport can grow and we can get more spaces to practice—so we can participate in sports tournaments around the world as other athletes do," says one member of the skating group. "Another thing we want to do is to show that no matter how you look, how old you are, or what’s your gender, you can be part of the skate community and feel the freedom of skateboarding. We believe that everyone deserves respect, and we must get rid of discrimination and mistreatment towards people who are different from you. Diversity makes beauty.”
