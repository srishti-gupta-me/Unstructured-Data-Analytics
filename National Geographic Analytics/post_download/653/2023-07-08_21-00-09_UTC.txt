A conservation effort has returned bison to the Amskapi Pikuni (Blackfeet Nation) tribal lands more than a century after the animal was nearly slaughtered to extinction.

As colonizers moved west, millions of buffalo were killed and brought to the edge of extinction. Millions more Native peoples were murdered, displaced, and forced to assimilate. By the end of the 19th century, only 300 buffalo were left in the wild and Native populations dropped to less than 300,000. Now, after more than 150 years, iinnii (buffalo) are returning to their homeland to roam free. Read the full story at the link in bio.
