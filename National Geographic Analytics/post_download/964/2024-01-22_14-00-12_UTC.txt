But if you want to be scientific, this is flehmen, a mammalian behavior. An animal (a horse or cat, for example) opens its mouth with the upper lip curled to increase access of the vomeronasal organ (or Jacobson’s organ) to a scent or pheromone. Animals do this to process info from other scents. You'll see this when lions and all kinds of cats are smelling something in the air they find intriguing or delectable, like the scent of a female.

Or perhaps they really are just laughing—at the fact that there are about 30 hyenas surrounding them and waiting for the exact moment the pride takes leave of the buffalo carcass it has been snacking on for hours. All joking aside.
