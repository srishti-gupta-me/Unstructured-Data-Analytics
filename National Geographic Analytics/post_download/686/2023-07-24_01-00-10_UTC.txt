Photo by Matthieu Paley @paleyphoto | I met Bakhik Gul, a young herder, on one of my walks across Afghanistanâ€™s Wakhan corridor in 2005. I explained in the Wakhi language that I was a foreigner walking with my wife and our donkey, and we were alone and on our way to Pakistan, crossing over the Pamir peaks and into the Karakoram Mountains. She was unimpressed, and soon said goodbye as she rounded up her cows. Years later, while photographing along the 24,000-mile (39,000 km) route of Paul Salopek's Out of Eden walk, I passed her village again. I found her parents and gave them a print of this image. I learned she had married and moved to a village across the river, but there was no bridge to reach it. See the full story at the link in bio and follow @paleyphoto and @outofedenwalk for more.
