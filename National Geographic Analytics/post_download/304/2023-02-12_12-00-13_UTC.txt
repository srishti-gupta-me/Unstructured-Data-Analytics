Photo by @beverlyjoubert | For lion cubs in the wilds of Botswana, the odds of survival can be precariously low—and it's often their mother’s care and fierce dedication that will be the deciding factor in beating those odds. She must shield her young from hunger and the elements, protect them from the menace of rival carnivores, and impart those critical early skills they’ll need to survive in the rough-and-tumble world of a top predator. Yet even amid the grueling work of motherhood, there is always time for a tender moment of grooming and affectionate nuzzling. It’s heartwarming to witness the ties that bind in the animal kingdom for #valentinesday. To see more of my work, follow me @beverlyjoubert.
