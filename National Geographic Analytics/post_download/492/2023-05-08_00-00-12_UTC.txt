Photo by @jasperdoest | In his workshop in Mardin, Turkey, 28-year-old Hasan K覺z覺l puts the finishing touches on a custom wheelchair for a stray pup paralyzed in a car accident. 

K覺z覺l earned himself the nickname "life repairer" for his work in helping animals with deformities or limb loss with whatever materials he has on hand. He looks forward to witnessing an animal begin to move again. "That moment is beautiful," he says. "Once I put the prothesis on, their whole center of gravity goes to the wheels. First they are scared of walking, but then in five minutes they start running."
