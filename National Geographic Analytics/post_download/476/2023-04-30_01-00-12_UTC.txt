The cabin, now managed by the National Park Service, contains items belonging to Hjalmer, including the knife on the table and a pair of darned socks on the floor. 

Manitou Island is one of 21 islands that make up the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, part of the National Park Service since 1970. Read the full story on Wisconsin’s Apostle Islands at the link in bio.
