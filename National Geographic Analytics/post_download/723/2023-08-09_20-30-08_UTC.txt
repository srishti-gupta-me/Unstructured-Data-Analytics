Photo by @martinedstrom | A lone paddler travels on the Huallaga River, part of Peru's Amazon Basin. A few years ago, I had the privilege of documenting the daily life of a few families in this area. Scenes like this weren't extraordinary to themâ€”but they were to me. Follow @martinedstrom for more on the story.
