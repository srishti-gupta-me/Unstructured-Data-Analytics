Photo by @acacia.johnson | A mother polar bear and two cubs roam the hillside of Kapp Waldburg on Spitsbergen, Norway. Here in the remote Svalbard archipelago, polar bears can be found anywhere, scavenging for food on shore during the summer months when sea ice is less prevalent. These bears were leaving a colony of nesting black-legged kittiwakes, whose eggs could make a snack for the mother and cubs.
