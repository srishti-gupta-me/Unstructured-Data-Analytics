Photo by @acacia.johnson | The first rays of a September morning illuminate an iceberg in Scoresby Sund, East Greenland.  To capture this image, a colleague and I launched zodiacs from our small expedition ship in the dark and drove to an exposed rock in the middle of a bay where polar bear encounters would be unlikely. There, we watched an otherworldly sunrise break over the landscape, painting icebergs calved from nearby glaciers.
