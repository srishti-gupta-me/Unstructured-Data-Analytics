Photo by @sofia_jaramillo5 | Alyssa Gonzalez stands for a portrait during a women’s mountain biking festival in Sedona, Arizona. It's part of a series I call Women Who Roam, for the @thisisroam attendees endeavoring to change the face of the cycling industry. 

Gonzalez is a professional cyclist and works as a DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) consultant. She's an advocate for gender diversity in cycling and a community builder focused on creating opportunities and experiences for women of color and others in marginalized communities.

“As a queer woman of color, the act of just showing up on the trails on my bike is radical," she says, "and I try to pass that message on and the joy of cycling to all folks I meet." 

"Biking has become a huge part of my life. It’s how I move my body, exercise, and process. It’s been the main way that I’ve found more diverse and inclusive communities to be part of. I’ve learned a lot about what I can do with my body and mind while on a bike, and it’s transferred to my everyday life. The bike has made me stronger, more confident, social, aware, and gritty.”

I asked what changes she’d like to see in the outdoor community. “More of an attitude that everyone has a space in the outdoors and in nature, and less of a gatekeeping mentality," she says. "I would love to see more respect and acknowledgment for Indigenous folks and their land. Indigenous sovereignty and the land back movement are so important for our climate, the outdoors, and the communities of Native folks in this country and beyond.”
