Photo by @yamashitaphoto | Fall foliage at its peak in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom: I was on assignment shooting a story on seasonal change in this remote area famous for its forests of sugar maples. It was an overcast day with occasional breaks in the clouds—my favorite kind of light—what I call in-and-out sunshine. I focused on a burst of light lasting only a few seconds to capture this quintessential Vermont landscape.
