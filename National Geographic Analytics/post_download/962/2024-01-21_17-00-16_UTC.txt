Photo by @amivitale | Ever wonder why elephants don't jump? It's all in their skeletal structure. If you examine their feet, you'll notice the bones point straight down, meaning they're essentially standing on their tiptoes. This design supports their immense weight but lacks the flexibility needed for jumping. These unique toes belong to an orphaned elephant residing in northern Kenya at Reteti Elephant Sanctuary, the first community-owned elephant sanctuary in Africa.
