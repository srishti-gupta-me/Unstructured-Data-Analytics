Photo by @nicholesobecki | Maasai Teresia Mwae waits for tea to be made at her friend's home near the alkaline Lake Natron, Tanzania, said to be one of the most inhospitable places on Earth. The water's extremely high salt content is poisonous to most animals and birds; many calcify if they die in the lake. The water temperature can reach a scalding 140 deg F (60 deg C). Inside the friend's house we can laze comfortably, but at midday the lake shimmers along this sun-scorched border with Kenya. For Teresia and other Maasai, this place is just called home, and bomas like this one dot the other-worldly landscape. To learn more about the remarkable world we share, follow along @nicholesobecki.
