Photo by @nadiashiracohen | Approaching Chile's Glaciar de los Témpanos, we sailed past electric blue icebergs and dodged almost transparent bergy bits. Every few minutes a loud boom echoed in the cove as chunks of the magnificent mass of ice calved into the fjord. All but two of Patagonia's glaciers are rapidly retreating due to warming temperatures. It's estimated that in as little as two decades Témpanos may no longer exist— and the land beneath it may will surge upward, no longer burdened by the weight of the ice.
