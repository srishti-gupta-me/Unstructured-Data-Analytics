In the United States, domestic cats kill up to 4 billion birds and 22 billion small mammals every year. These deaths exceed other man-made causes of wildlife mortality like accidental poisoning and habitat destruction and pose an imminent threat to the health and diversity of wildlife. Scientists have developed a gene therapy contraceptive for cats that could reduce these deaths. One solution is to rein in cat fertilityâ€”the treatment is easy to administer and lasts a lifetime.
