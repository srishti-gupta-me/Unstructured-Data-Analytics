Photo by @jasperdoest | A yellow-billed kite soars over Katwe Market in Kampala, Uganda. It's the largest wholesaler of nsenene, a katydid species considered a national delicacy. Vendors from all over the country arrive around sunrise to be the first to sell freshly harvested katydids, which are still alive and stored in large bags. Occasionally katydids escape from the bag, but then they face another challenge: these birds of prey, which also have their eyes on a fresh katydid snack. Follow photographer @jasperdoest as he explores the relationship between humankind and nature. #nsenene #uganda #grasshoppers #market
