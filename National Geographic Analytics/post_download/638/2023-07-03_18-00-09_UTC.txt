The gut microbiome is made up of all the microbiota that live in our intestinal tracts. These minuscule organisms help the body break down carbohydrates, proteins, and sugars into useful nutrients and process fiber in the colon. More complex relationships between gut microbiota and health exist too—for example, numerous studies have shown that the excess or lack of certain bacteria in the gut have a strong correlation to the onset of diabetes. There’s also a lot of emerging research on another complex element of the gut microbiome—its relationship to the brain, known as the “gut-brain axis."

Knowing it's crucial to various aspects of our physical well-being, how do you maintain a healthy gut microbiome (or re-balance it after the stomach flu or a few too many slices of cake)? Experts recommend eating foods high in fiber, incorporating fermented foods, and keeping sugar intake low. Learn more about your gut and ways to keep it healthy at the link in bio.
