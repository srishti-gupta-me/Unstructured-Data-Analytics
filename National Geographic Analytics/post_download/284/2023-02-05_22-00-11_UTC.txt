Photo by @beckythale | When journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones showed up for a portrait wearing a fuchsia shirt, it was a gift. Sometimes I can influence the details of a shoot, but this project came together quickly. With just a few hours' notice, I hopped on the train from Washington, D.C., to New York City for the session. It's not often that I have the opportunity to photograph someone whose work I follow. Hannah-Jones's "The 1619 Project" has challenged me to think about the narratives that have shaped my identity and has stayed with me. And though she doesn't need a fuchsia shirt to make her extraordinary, I was grateful for it nonetheless. For the full story on her project, see the link in bio.
