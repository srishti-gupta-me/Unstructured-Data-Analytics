These birds lay two to three eggs and can live up to 50 years in the wild, where they’re found at the edges of tropical woodlands and palm savannas. They form strong social bonds, and each and every one has its own individual personality traits. Comical and loud, they are the clowns of the forests; unfortunately, despite efforts to increase their numbers, the population is decreasing because of habitat destruction for hydroelectric dams and agriculture and the illegal pet trade.
