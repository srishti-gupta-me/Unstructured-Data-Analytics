This year, the Seattle area recorded the worst city air quality in the world on October 19; air quality consistently deteriorated throughout the summer and fall because of smoke from wildfiresâ€”and the problem is getting worse. From 2009-2014, Washington residents were exposed to an average of 22 smoky days per year. From 2016-2020, residents were exposed to an annual average of 34. Climate change increases the wildfire season length, frequency, and burn area. Among the many impacts, it's reducing the ability of adventurers to safely recreate outdoors.
