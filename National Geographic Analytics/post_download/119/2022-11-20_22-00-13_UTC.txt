Today they’re in homes and businesses, as wealthy collectors indulge in a controversial hobby. Here, 11-year-old Luke Phipps sits atop a Triceratops fossil—still in a plaster “jacket” used for carefully transporting a fossil from the field to a lab—with Chris Morrow, owner of CK Preparations, a commercial fossil company in Montana. Luke found the fossil while digging with his father, Clayton Phipps, a rancher and amateur paleontologist known as the dinosaur cowboy. #dinosaurs #dino #dinosaur #collection #triceratops
