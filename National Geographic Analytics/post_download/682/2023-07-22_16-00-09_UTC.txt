Photo by @joelsartore | Alaska's North Slope has a reputation for harboring clouds of fearless mosquitoes. I learned this the hard way while on assignment there for National Geographic in 2006.

Desperate after three days without taking a single good photo, I decided to turn the camera on myself. I took off my shoes and socks in a scenic place and let the mosquitos eat me alive for 20 or so minutes. They piled on so thick they made a crackling sound. Later, my feet itched so badly that I scratched them raw for three hours straight.

There were two silver linings to this experiment: This image became one of the most talked about photos of my career, and I was given a gift certificate for a pedicure from the magazine's director of photography. I still donâ€™t think my feet looked that bad.
