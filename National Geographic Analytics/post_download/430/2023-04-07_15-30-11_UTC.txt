Photo by @joelsartore | You can help the North American beaver this International Beaver Day by attending—or even organizing—a stream, river, or lake cleanup near your home to preserve aquatic habitats. We almost lost this species because of unregulated trapping during the 19th and 20th centuries, when their pelts were in high demand. Now protected from overexploitation, beavers have replenished their numbers over most of the continent and have provided useful knowledge on everything from swimming techniques to dam building, even to flood control. Beaver dams maintain healthy, balanced ecosystems by controlling runoff, erosion, and floods; they also keep the water table high enough to support rich vegetation. With all that beavers do for us, let’s help them keep their home free of debris! Photo taken @newildliferehab, a center that saves injured and orphaned wildlife.
