Photo by @amytoensing | I was invited to a Bedouin wedding while traveling in the Sinai peninsula in Egypt in 2008 and was fortunate to end up in a private area with the bride and her family. Music was playing, and the girls in this image were so excited to dance for the bride. I love how photography freezes moments that might otherwise be overlooked or unknownâ€”a magical time machine that gives us a chance to consider our world a little deeper over and over again.
