Photo by Luján Agusti @lujanag | I was on assignment to document the Baqueanos, a long-established family who work the land and raise cattle in Argentina's Tierra del Fuego. The story spoke to the deep bond that many people in Tierra del Fuego have with the landscape. Harsh and unforgiving, the territory is also a place of great beauty and abundance. The Baqueanos family have learned to live in harmony with it, with horses as their essential partners.

Aurelia is part of the family—a calm, curious child who loves the outdoors. As she rode her horse, I was struck by the way they seemed to be in sync, two parts of a whole. This photo is more than just a portrait; it's a reminder of the power of the human-animal bond. It's also a testament to the resilience of the people who have learned to thrive here. 

Portraiture is a dialogue with the photographer: a moment when two people meet and something special, almost magical, happens. Follow me at @lujanag to learn more about my homeland, Tierra del Fuego.
