Photo by @paoloverzone | Wahib Anton, a conservator at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, cleans the second of three nesting coffins that held Tutankhamun’s mummy. This second coffin was made of embellished gilded wood clad with inlaid vitreous paste and decorated with a rishi, or feathered, pattern. For more than a century, the Egyptian Museum has been renowned for its immense collection of ancient Egyptian artifacts, a staggering assemblage of more than 120,000 items. Some of those were held in storage, however. But with the opening of the new Grand Egyptian Museum nearby, many of those artifacts, including nearly all of the 5,000 objects discovered in King Tut’s tomb, will be on display for the first time, in two exhibition halls devoted entirely to Egypt’s most famous pharaohs.
