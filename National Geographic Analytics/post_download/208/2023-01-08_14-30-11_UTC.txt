Photo by @sofia_jaramillo5 | Judith Kasiama, who also goes by Juju Milay, poses for a portrait during Roam Fest in Sedona, Arizona, a mountain biking event series for women riders. The portrait is part of an ongoing project I call Women Who Roam, which highlights women of color and those from the LGBTQ+ community who are changing the face of the cycling industry. Kasiama is the founder of @colourthetrails, a collective that advocates for inclusivity in the outdoors. 

“Biking is the freedom of mobility without barriers," she says. "Biking is an opportunity to connect with other people. It’s a sense of community, it’s access to transportation, and above all, for me, it brings a lot of joy and childlike wonder.”

Based in Vancouver, Canada, Kasiama noticed barriers to mountain biking when she first began riding. She felt like the marketing by the bike industry promoted only the gnarliest, fastest, and most extreme riding, not the experiences of everyday riders. She also didn’t find anyone who looked like her in the brands’ marketing materials, which ran counter to her experience.

Through her work, Kasiama is helping adults and kids alike break down the barriers to access in the outdoors. “I know we have a long way to go, but for me, I just want more little Black girls doing stuff in the outdoors. To see someone who looks like them in these spaces and hopefully they can have the courage and feel supported in mountain biking or mountaineering or whatever it is.”
