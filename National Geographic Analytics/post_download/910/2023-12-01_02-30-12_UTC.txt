Photo by Karine Aigner @kaigner | I was not there to photograph cats. I was lying out in the open—face down in the dirt, exposed to everything, fumbling around, and intently focused on, well, a bug. A wasp to be exact. And then there he was, as bobcats are, walking 10 feet to my right, with eyes on me. He knew I was there. He padded around, confident and sure. He stopped mere feet in front of me. The familiar tail switch, the look back, the pause—I knew what he was going to do. I looked down, changed some camera settings, and when I looked up again, this is what was in front of me. I had too much lens and no choices. He drank as the birds screamed, intruder! Then he got up, crossed to the bushes, turned back one last time. The tail twitched. He peed on the cactus, letting me know it was his, and then he was gone.

It never gets old. Never. Every individual is a different character, a different personality, a different cat.
