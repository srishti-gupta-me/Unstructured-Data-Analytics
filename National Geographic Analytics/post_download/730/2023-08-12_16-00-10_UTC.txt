Photo by @amivitale | Today is World Elephant Day! A world without elephants would impact us all. Elephants are our ecosystem "engineers‚Äù because they shape habitats in a multitude of ways. They're huge mobile composting units. They create water sources in dry landscapes by digging wells with their tusks. They move seeds across vast landscapes. They clear paths through dense vegetation that ultimately benefit other animals and people.

The Reteti Elephant Sanctuary in northern Kenya is changing the lives of both elephants and people. This extraordinary group does so much to rescue, rehabilitate, and rewild elephant calves that are orphaned as a result of drought, human-wildlife conflict, natural mortality, and in rare cases, poaching. Here, Mary Lengees comforts one of the calves. Lengees and most of the team at Reteti were recruited from the local community and are deeply devoted to caring for these animals. They have done so much through hope, resilience, and imagination. Follow @amivitale to learn more about what we're doing to support elephants. @r.e.s.c.u.e @vital.impacts #WorldElephantDay
