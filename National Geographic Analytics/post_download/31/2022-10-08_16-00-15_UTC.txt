Photo by @gabrielegalimbertiphoto | This is Naya, 3, in Cahuita, Costa Rica. Wherever I travel in the world, I take portraits of children with their favorite playthings for my ongoing Toy Stories project. In visiting over 60 countries, I've recorded the genuine joy that unites kids despite their diverse backgrounds. Whether the child owns a veritable fleet of miniature cars or a single stuffed monkey, the pride they have is moving, funny, and thought-provoking. Follow me @gabrielegalimbertiphoto for more photos and stories. #toys #child #kid #toy #toystories #play
