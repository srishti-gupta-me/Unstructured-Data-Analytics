Photo by @lynseyaddario | At Iraq's Balad Air Base, injured U.S. soldiers await medical evacuation inside a military cargo aircraft after being wounded during the battle of Fallujah, November 2004. 

The interior lights of the plane are in an "alarm red" code, indicating the base is under attackâ€”usually by incoming mortar rounds. This month marks the 20-year anniversary of the start of the Iraq war. #Iraqwar #LynseyAddario
