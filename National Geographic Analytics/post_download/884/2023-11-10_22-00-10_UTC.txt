Photo by @jaimerojo | Predators are slowly returning to the forests of Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve in the state of Queretaro in northern Mexico. Much of the country has suffered a severe loss of wildlife, but in these mountains, just a hundred miles (160 km) from Mexico City, sustainable management and restoration efforts by Grupo Ecologico Sierra Gorda, a family-led grassroots conservation organization, have resulted in a thriving population of wildlife. This includes mountain lions, which had disappeared in the area because of retaliatory killings by landowners and cattle ranchers. This camera trap image of a mountain lion in the mist required more than four months of trial and error (and lots of fogged lenses).
