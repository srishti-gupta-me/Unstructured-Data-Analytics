Photo by @javier_aznar_photography | Sachatamia ilex is a glass frog with impressive, beautiful eyes. I observed a few individuals during my last visit to the Ecuadorian Choc√≥. Parental care is rare with this species, as with other glass frogs, and during the night, they can be found in the vegetation close to streams and rivers. Thanks to nonprofits such as @fundacion.jocotoco, this region of Ecuador and the animals that inhabit it have a chance to survive.
