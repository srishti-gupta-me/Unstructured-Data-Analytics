Photo by @erintrieb | A women’s rights activist (who is not named for her protection) puts on makeup at her apartment in Kabul. She shares a flat with two other single women, which is viewed as unacceptable in Afghan society. Most landlords in Afghanistan will not rent a home to a single woman. 

Though they are relatively few, single women who choose to have female roommates or live alone are often harassed by their neighbors, threatened, or forced to vacate their apartments, accused of being prostitutes. The woman pictured here has since fled Afghanistan, stating she’s received death threats from the Taliban. She hopes to immigrate to the U.S. or Europe but struggles to find visa opportunities.
