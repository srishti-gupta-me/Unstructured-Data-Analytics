Photo by @orsolyahaarberg | The islands of the Norwegian Helgeland archipelago are seldom covered by snow near sea level. With coastal Norway warmed by the North Atlantic Current, they have relatively mild winters. But I happened to be on DÃ¸nna Island right after a snowstorm. Look closely between the trees and the mountains for a white church that suddenly emerges from this wintry scene. Follow me @orsolyahaarberg for more images from the Nordic countries.
