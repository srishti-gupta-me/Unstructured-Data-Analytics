Photo by @kiliiiyuyan | I’m on assignment on the Ningaloo Reef, in the sparkling waters off western Australia. This was one of those times where I was actually doing what my friends think I do all the time—hanging out with humpback whales and diving with gorgeous lionfish over red coral. The Ningaloo Reef is a fringing reef, meaning that it fans out from shore. Nutrients from an offshore upwelling attract all manner of species up to the reef's charismatic big three: humpbacks, whale sharks, and manta rays. Thanks to protections by UNESCO and a dedicated local community, 45,000 humpbacks have their babies and migrate through each year. Follow me @kiliiiyuyan for more.
