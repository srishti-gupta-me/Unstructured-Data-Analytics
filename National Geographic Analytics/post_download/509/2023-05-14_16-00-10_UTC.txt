Photo by @kiliiiyuyan | A curious sea otter pup glances at me while floating on the belly of its mother in Kasitsna Bay, Alaska. These marine mammals don't possess the layer of blubber that allows others, like seals, to stay warm. Keeping their fur well groomed helps, and mother otters will groom their pups for the first three months, in between acts of love such as diving for food and nursing.
