Photo by @beverlyjoubert | A moment of affection in the heart of Botswanaâ€™s Okavango Delta captures the essence of the vital social bonds among male lions. From hunting success to territorial defense, these alliances are crucial to survival in the challenging, competitive, and often brutal world of these big cats. It takes time and many shared trials for these bonds to develop, which makes moments like this one more important than they might seem. Grooming rituals, mutual care, and shared affection form the very fabric of the ties that bind. To see more of my work, follow me @beverlyjoubert.
