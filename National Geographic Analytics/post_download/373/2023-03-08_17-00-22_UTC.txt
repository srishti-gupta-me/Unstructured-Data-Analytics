Photo by @luisadorr | Teffy is a member of the ImillaSkate collective, whose members wear traditional pollera skirts and hats, in Cochabamba, Bolivia. For her, skateboarding is not only a sport, it's a lifestyle.

"Even though the discrimination against Indigenous people in Bolívia is huge, I believe that wearing a pollera to skateboard identifies myself with my roots," she says. It's empowering for the group, which aspires to attract more women to the sport and tackle stereotypes. 

Teffy stands on the city's San Pedro hill. "When you look at this view," she says, "you see that nature thrives here and that not all is lost because of technological developments and population growth—and the most important of all, I'm proud of being K'ochala."
