Photo by @joelsartore | Found in rainforests throughout South America, bare-tailed woolly opossums spend most of their time hidden in the dense high canopy, where they nest in tree hollows or in gathered leaves. A nocturnal species, opossums like this one in Florida's @shellfactorynaturepark will move quietly through the trees, feasting on fruit, nectar, tree gum, and arthropods as they explore within their range.
