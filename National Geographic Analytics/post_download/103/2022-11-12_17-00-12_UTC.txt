He recalls arriving in the aftermath of the destruction and digging through the rubble with his bare hands. Destroyed in an air strike by the Saudi Arabian-led coalition in May 2015, the museum contained more than 12,000 archaeological objects, representing the history of an ancient center of Arab and Islamic culture.
