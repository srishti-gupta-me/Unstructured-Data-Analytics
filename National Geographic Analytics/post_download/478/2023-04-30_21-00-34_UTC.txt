The observatory‘s 20-meter (65 ft) diameter radio telescope, seen in the background, looks into the most distant galaxies to capture data that’s crucial for climate research and ensuring accurate GPS information. The observatory’s antennas record signals from distant celestial objects known as quasars, up to 13 billion light-years away. From pulsating lights, they measure and monitor regional and global changes in the Earth’s crust, the planet’s rotation, how fast it’s orbiting the sun, and its exact position in space—all factors that affect our climate. Such metrics help countries make decisions about climate, sea rise, and other significant changes affecting our world. Please follow @estherhorvath for more polar science stories.
