In her research with the Institut Botànic de Barcelona, she investigates how migratory behavior is encoded in their genome and has contributed to the discovery that painted lady butterflies undergo the world's longest butterfly migration. Her study, which shows the species’ overwintering locations in tropical Africa, is soon to be published in the journal PNAS. | Thanks to scientists like Aurora Garcia-Berro, we now know how harmful emissions and widespread development are disrupting the migration patterns of painted lady butterflies. @dhl_global is tackling this urgent issue by pledging to use the world's first battery-powered aircraft in #logistics for short-haul transportation in the near future.
