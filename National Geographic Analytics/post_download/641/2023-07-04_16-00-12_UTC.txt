Photo by Muhammed Muheisen @mmuheisen | A pleasure cruise makes its way along one of Amsterdam’s canals in summer, shortly before the sun sets. The city’s famous canals go back to the Middle Ages, when they were built primarily for defense and water management; later, during the late 16th and 17th centuries, they played a major part in Amsterdam’s commercial growth and expansion. Reflecting a mercantile spirit, many of the buildings along the canals were designed for mixed use: at once a residence, storage unit, and place of business.
