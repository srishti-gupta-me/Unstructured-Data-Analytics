Photo by @Lynseyaddario | Mading Akol, 11, swims in Pawel beneath dried fish, the only available food, in one of dozens of villages flooded across Jonglei state in South Sudan, October 23, 2021. That year, parts of South Sudan experienced some of the worst flooding in six decades, exacerbating illnesses commonly seen and transmitted in rainy season: malaria, acute respiratory infections, and diarrhea. For three consecutive years, entire swaths and villages of Jonglei state were completely submerged. The reasons are various but boil down to a combination of climate change, deforestation in neighboring Ethiopia, population growth, and poor water management across Africa, experts say. The flooding continued into 2022. Photographed with a grant from @insidenatgeo. #climatechange #deforestation #southsudan #NationalGeographicSociety #LynseyAddario
