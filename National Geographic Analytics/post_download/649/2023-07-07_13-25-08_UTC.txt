Photo by Matthieu Paley @paleyphoto | Archaeologists investigate the desert near AlUla in Saudi Arabia. Here, on the rubble-strewn plains of Harrat Uwayrid, Lauren Swift and her colleagues look at structures and tombs from the Neolithic era that probably date to more than 8,000 years ago. Under a scorching sun, Swift handed me a tiny piece of stone. "This is perhaps from an old necklace," she said. For me, witnessing this work was simply a kidâ€™s dream come true! | Experience the extraordinary monuments and ancient history in the vast desert of #AlUla.
