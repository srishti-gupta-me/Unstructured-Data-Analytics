Photo by @ismailferdous | I recently caught Edward Hopper's New York exhibit at the city's Whitney Museum. Shortly after, I rounded a corner and came upon this scene. The resulting image read like a painting straight out of Hopper's collection. I decided to dedicate a few verses to the moment:

In West Village, the winter evening falls
As the sun sets behind the city walls.
The streets are silent, the air is chill.
The lamps are lit, casting a cozy glow
As people hurry home, walking slow.
A wondrous sight in the fading light.
