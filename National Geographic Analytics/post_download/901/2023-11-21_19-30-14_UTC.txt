Photo by @carltonward | Betty Osceola is a member of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, an airboat captain, and a powerful advocate for her Everglades home. As we mark Native American Heritage Month in November, I am grateful for her willingness to share her native lands with me and the world, including in her role as a lead character in the National Geographic film "Path of the Panther," now streaming on @disneyplus. The Seminole and Miccosukee are the last Native Americans living in Florida. 

Betty Osceola advocates for better and more equitable management of Everglades water. She is asking the Army Corps of Engineers to open all the floodgates along the Tamiami Trail—a 264-mile stretch of highway between Miami and Tampa—that are currently holding back water and drowning her ancestral lands. Roads, drainage canals, and development have been blocking and diverting the flow of Everglades water for the past century. The Tamiami Trail in particular has served as a dam blocking the water. South of the road, Everglades National Park has been deprived of water that once flowed seamlessly from the north, and north of the road, Miccosukee tribal lands have been drowning under too much water artificially held back by the road and by water management practices that have prioritized flood control for densely populated areas closer to the coast. During that time, 70 percent of the tree islands that Osceola and her people have historically relied upon and which have great cultural significance for the Miccosukee, have been lost. 

Through new Everglades restoration efforts, several miles of the Tamiami Trail have been elevated into bridges to help rebalance the flow of water. But more work is needed in the multiyear restoration plan, with continued investment from the U.S. and Florida governments, in order for water to flow more naturally and for the ecosystem to more fully recover. #NativeAmericanHeritageMonth
