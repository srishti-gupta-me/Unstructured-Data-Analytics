Photo by Robbie Shone @shonephoto | Slovenia's Zelske cave lies at the base of several natural rock bridges. In the background, two explorers walk under one of the "skylights" where, long ago, the cave's roof collapsed. This beautiful arched portal was shaped over hundreds of thousands of years by constant erosion from the River Rak.
