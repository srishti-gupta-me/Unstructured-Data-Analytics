Photo by @joelsartore | This Carolina wren looked even rougher around the edges when it was first brought to Wild Bird Rehabilitation Inc. in St. Louis, Missouri. The reason for its disheveled appearance? It was caught in fly paper, a common death trap for songbirds, along with the sticky traps used for mice and insects. Please consider avoiding these devices in areas where songbirds are present.
