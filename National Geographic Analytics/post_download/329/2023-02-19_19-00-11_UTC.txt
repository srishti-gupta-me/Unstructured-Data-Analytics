Taking the name given to the area by the Tuareg, nomads who have ruled that region for centuries, the site offers a glimpse of the Green Sahara, an era of time between 10,000 and 5,000 years ago when the land was lush with vegetation. People known as Kiffians were the first to settle in Gobero more than 9,700 years ago. Follow @paoloverzone for more images and stories.
