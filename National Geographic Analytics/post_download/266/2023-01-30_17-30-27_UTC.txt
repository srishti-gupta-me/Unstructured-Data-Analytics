Photo by @nicholesobecki | One of the fastest animals in the world is racing for survival. Huge reductions in their natural habitat are among the threats that have pushed the number of adult cheetahs globally to around just 7,000. The fight against the newest threat—rampant trafficking, with cheetahs being sold over social media—is being waged in an unexpected place: Somaliland, a resource-poor, self-declared autonomous republic in the Horn of Africa. Central to its efforts is the legal front, where many are pushing to increase jail sentences for traffickers. These five cubs were shown to a judge as evidence during the trial of an infamous trafficker. Moving wild animals like cheetahs to safety is a dangerous undertaking, as it requires maintaining the animal's safety and care throughout the journey. Logistical expertise, coordination with veterinary care and local authorities, and genuine respect for the animals’ well-being must be perfectly orchestrated. | That’s where @dhl_global comes in.
