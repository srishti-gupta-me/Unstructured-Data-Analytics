Photo by @nadiashiracohen | The Atob√° branco bird, a threatened species, thrives in the protected Archipelago of Abrolhos, off the coast of Bahia in Brazil, far from predators. The females lay two eggs. When they hatch, she must choose between the stronger of her two offspring to raise. The weaker one is left to fend for itself, most often succumbing to the difficulties of survival. I'm currently traveling the world by sailboat with my family. Follow me for more scenes of my seafaring adventures.
