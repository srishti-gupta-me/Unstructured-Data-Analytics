Photo by @beverlyjoubert | Cats being cats … it’s a tale as old as time. The inherent playfulness, mischief, and exploratory instinct are all a vital part of a young predator’s education. Pouncing, stalking, mock battles, and boisterous play are not just entertainment for a growing cub with energy reserves aplenty. They’re fundamental to honing the physical abilities, coordination, and strategy skills that make lions such formidable hunters. The mother of these cubs in Kenya’s Masai Mara National Reserve displayed remarkable patience with her offspring's antics, even when her tail became the target.
