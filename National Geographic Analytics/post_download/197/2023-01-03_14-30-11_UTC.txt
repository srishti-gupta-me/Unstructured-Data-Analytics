Photo by @acacia.johnson | Pilots fly in formation down the Knik River Valley near Palmer, Alaska. Since the first mail-delivery plane took off in 1924, small aircraft have played a critical role in Alaskaâ€™s development. Today, with only 20% of the state accessible by road, nearly all of Alaska is highly dependent on aviation, both for essential transport between remote communities and to access remote wilderness areas. For many pilots, flying is simply a way of life: a way to connect to the landscape and to each other.
