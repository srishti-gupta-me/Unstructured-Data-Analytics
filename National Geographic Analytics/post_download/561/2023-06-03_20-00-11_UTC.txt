Photo by Luján Agusti @lujanag | Lago Escondido, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. Jorge Tagle, a member of the generations-old Bronzovich gaucho family, poses in front of a fabric background. A lover of country life and horses, Tagle works in the family business, Baqueanos de Tierra del Fuego. Settlers in Tierra del Fuego, nicknamed “the end of the world,” developed a culture based on the arduous farmwork needed to survive the low temperatures and rugged geography of the continental south. Here, those who choose to live outside of cities do so for the love of freedom and nature—and they do so knowing that they will have to endure the inclement weather. I documented the life and work of Baqueanos de Tierra del Fuego in southern Patagonia. Follow me @lujanag to learn more about life and traditions in Tierra del Fuego.
