Photo by @ismailferdous | An immersive experience at New York City's American Museum of Natural History, "Invisible Worlds" delves into the intricate networks of life that exist at different scales, many imperceptible to the human eye. From the microorganisms that thrive in our bodies to the cosmic web that binds the universe together, displays showcase the interconnectedness of all living things. The exhibit's use of technology allows visitors to become part of the story, with their movements affecting the projections around them. For more pictures follow me @ismailferdous.
