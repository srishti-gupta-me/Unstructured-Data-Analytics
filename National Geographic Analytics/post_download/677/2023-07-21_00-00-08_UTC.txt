Although birth control pills on the market today are safer than when they were first introduced, there are still questions about how they work and their side effects—particularly as the FDA recently approved one version to be sold without a prescription. Here are a few common questions (and answers) about the pill:

1. Besides preventing pregnancy, how might the pill help me? All birth control pills can help make periods lighter and less painful, and lower your risk of ectopic pregnancy.

2. Will I gain weight on the pill? Studies have not found that the pill leads to significant weight gain. (The ring, patch, and intrauterine devices also aren’t associated with weight gain.) It’s tricky to blame the pill for weight gain because many factors like diet and stress can contribute.

3. Does the pill increase my chances of developing blood clots? About 1 in 3,000 women taking the pill will develop a blood clot, according to the National Blood Clot Alliance. Although this is one of the most significant risks associated with the pill, it’s still extremely rare, experts say.
