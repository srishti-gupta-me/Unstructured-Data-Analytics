Photo by @daviddoubilet | A critically endangered hawksbill sea turtle soars through the sea in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. This curious turtle swam with us all day on several dives, peering over our shoulders. During our dive breaks, she'd wait at the surface until we rolled in. We all submerged together. I've photographed hundreds of sea turtles around the world, but diving with this one was magicalâ€”and leaving was hard. If all goes right in her world, she could live 50+ years. But if she approaches the wrong fisherman, her curiosity could be her demise. I often think of her and the joy I felt that day.
