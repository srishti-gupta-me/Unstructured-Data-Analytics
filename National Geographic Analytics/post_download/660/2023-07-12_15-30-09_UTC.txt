Photo by @jasperdoest | The mystery of why the Calabria region in Italy has so many centenarians may be explained by fasting, according to Valter Longo, a biochemist from the University of Southern California. Longo theorizes that during times of poverty, people in Calabria often ate very little, typically just pasta with olive oil and legumes. To test if a diet that mimics fasting can reset the body’s metabolism, Longo is recruiting 500 people with health problems, such as obesity, from the region. Every three months, participants will consume a combination of nut-based or chocolate-crisp bars, spearmint or hibiscus tea, an algal oil capsule, vegetable soup, a multivitamin and mineral supplement, almond-and-kale crackers, olives, and a glycerol drink for five days—only enough to stave off hunger. “We are hoping to demonstrate that this changes the health of most people,” Longo says.
