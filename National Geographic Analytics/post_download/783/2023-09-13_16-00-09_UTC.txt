Fifteen different periodical cicada groups, or “broods,” live in forests across the eastern U.S., emerging in 13- to 17-year cycles. In 2024, two of these groups will emerge simultaneously for the first time in 221 years—an event rarer than Halley’s comet. However, some of these cicadas have made an appearance a year early.
