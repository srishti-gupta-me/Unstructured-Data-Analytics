Photo by @javier_aznar_photography | No, this is not a scene from "Alien vs. Predator." It's a scorpion (Tityus sp.) feeding on a small centipede. I captured the image at night in the Ecuadorian Choc√≥, a protected forest. Follow @javier_aznar_photography and @fundacion.jocotoco to learn more. #scorpion #ecuador #centipede #predation
