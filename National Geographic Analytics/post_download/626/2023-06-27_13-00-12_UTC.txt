Photo by @andrea_frazzetta | While working on a travel story, I arrived in Panama's San Blas Islands on a small biplane with a bunch of tourists. The plane lands on a tiny runway on an islet in the middle of the ocean. From there, small boats depart for other islets scattered throughout this enchanted archipelago off the coast of Panama that is administered by the Kuna people.

I spent a couple of days on one of these islets, staying in a hut, sleeping in a hammock, and eating fish. In the evenings, I would grab my tripod and make the five-minute walk around the island, looking for the best frame to capture the beauty of the blue hour. Sometimes life is sweet like that.
