Photo by @chrisburkard | If you watch raw lava emanate from a volcanic fissure, then listen to the cracking and popping as it settles to coolâ€”it's almost impossible not to feel a connection with the eruption. During my assignment to document the Meradalir volcano, I focused on capturing the scale of this natural phenomenon, trying to communicate the feeling of standing at the foot of a new eruption within the mossy hills of the Reykjanes Peninsula. 

An unforgettable series of events led to this image being selected to live among the National Geographic's Photos of the Year for 2022. Follow me for more.
