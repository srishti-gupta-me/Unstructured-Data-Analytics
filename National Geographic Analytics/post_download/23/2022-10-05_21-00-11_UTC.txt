Photo by Keith Ladzinski @ladzinski | A giant sequoia, roughly 300 feet (90m) tall, towers over the surrounding white fir trees in California's Sequoia National Park. These giants are endemic to a small part of the Sierra Nevada, where they drink upwards of 500 gallons per day and can live well over 3,000 years. As resilient as they are, each year they're increasingly threatened by wildfires. I photographed this beautiful tree under cloudy midnight skies filled with much needed rain.
