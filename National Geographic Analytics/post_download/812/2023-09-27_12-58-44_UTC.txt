“You can call me Eggeun,” he says. “This is my Indigenous Mi’kmaq name.” 

Eggeun is an independent guide who focuses on Indigenous tourism. We were at the Metepenagiag Heritage Park in New Brunswick, Canada, which is dedicated to preserving, showcasing, and reviving Mik’maq culture, tradition, and language. Eggeun was touching in his honesty and has a soft-spoken manner. 

“Language is the first step to preserving knowledge,” he says. “Our people have lived, fished, and hunted here since time immemorial. No one can take that away from us. In the ‘70s, when I grew up, we were beaten by our teachers when we spoke our language. Now we have Indigenous schools teaching our mother tongue to the new generation. I am a hopeful man!” 

We went foraging for wild rosebuds, and all the while Eggeun explained his deep respect for the Elders and how he looks to them for information about Mi'kmaq heritage. 

“We also talk to other First Nation people in Canada and beyond to exchange cultural information and fill gaps in our knowledge. So much has been lost. Now we stand proud, regaining that knowledge.” | Embrace Canada's rich cultures, vast landscapes, and heartwarming interactions from coast to coast @explorecanada
