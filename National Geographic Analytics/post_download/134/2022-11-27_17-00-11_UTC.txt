Photo by @acacia.johnson | Inuit elder Peugatuk Ettuk’s dog team pulls a sledge across the sea ice near Arctic Bay, Nunavut. In this part of the eastern Canadian Arctic, the Inuit have used dog teams for travel and hunting for millennia. Although most people now rely on snowmobiles for transportation, Ettuk said he still preferred the companionship of his dogs—and pointed out that unlike snowmobiles, dog teams don’t break down.
