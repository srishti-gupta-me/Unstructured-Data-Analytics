Photo by @luisadorr | Daniela Santiv치침ez, 26, is a member of ImillSkate, a women's skateboarding collective in Cochabamba, Bolivia.

As a child, she was introduced to the skating world by her brother. After she graduated from university, in 2019, she bought her first skateboard and dedicated herself to practicing.

As a nod to the their heritage, the collective performs in traditional pollera skirts, which are mostly associated with Indigenous women from the highlands. "They're considered part of the marginalized population in Bolivia," says Santiv치침ez, whose great-grandmother wore polleras. The group aims to instill cultural pride and eradicate discrimination.
