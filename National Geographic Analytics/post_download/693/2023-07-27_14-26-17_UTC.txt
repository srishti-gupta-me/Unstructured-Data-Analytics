Photo by Dina Litovsky @dina_litovsky | One of my favorite things about travel is experiencing new cultures. On a recent trip to Fort Worth, Texas, I had the chance to meet Jose, a drover and member of the Fort Worth Herd who demonstrated cattle roping for me. Jose’s roping techniques were beautiful to watch and looked like dance moves. The Fort Worth Herd oversees one of the city’s oldest and most unique traditions: a twice-daily longhorn cattle drive along East Exchange Avenue in the Stockyards National Historic District. The events commemorate a time in the 1800s when drovers herded cattle along the Chisholm Trail. Between drives, members of the Herd educate visitors on what life was like for drovers on the trail. | From outdoor adventures to big-city skylines, there are a million different trips to @traveltex, but the only one that matters is yours.
