In August 2021, when the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, a way of life with freedoms and civil rights that many Afghans cherished for two decades was turned upside down. The Taliban cracked down, arresting, beating, and kidnapping women rights’ activists. The woman pictured here says she has received death threats and was beaten by the Taliban with the butt of an AK-47 rifle for participating in public protests. She has since fled the country, hoping to immigrate to the U.S. or Europe, but struggles to find visa opportunities for herself and her family, who remain in Afghanistan.
