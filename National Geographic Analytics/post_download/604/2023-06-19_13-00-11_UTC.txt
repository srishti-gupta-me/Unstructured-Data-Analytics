Photo by @laurakmorton | During last year’s Juneteenth Parade in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, participants paused at sites along the route that remain historically significant to the city's Black community. One of the stops was St. Paul's A.M.E. Zion Church, the city's oldest congregation of Black community members, which dates to 1838. Gettysburg itself is known as the site of the American Civil War’s deadliest battle. I photographed the parade while working on a project about American celebrations.
