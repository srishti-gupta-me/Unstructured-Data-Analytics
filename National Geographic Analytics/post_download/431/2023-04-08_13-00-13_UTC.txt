Photo by @chrisburkard | It was circa 2012, and Surfer magazine and the American retailer Patagonia sent us to Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula to explore a remote stretch of beach where the water temperature dips to 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5°C) and rumors of beautiful waves exist. But on this day, the surf was flat and the crew felt restless, so we attempted to catch dinner and fly-fish in the river near our camp. I remember glancing up from the river’s edge and seeing perfect lenticular clouds swirling around Kamchatka’s volcanoes. Our fixer, Sergey, sat atop his 21-passenger Soviet troop carrier, soaking in the view with awe even though he most likely had seen it many times before. One by one, the rest of the crew noticed the symphony of color and stood mesmerized, all in silent agreement that this moment would sit as the peak of our expedition.
