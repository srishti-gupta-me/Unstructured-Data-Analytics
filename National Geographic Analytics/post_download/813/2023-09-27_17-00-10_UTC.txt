Photo by Aaron Huey @argonautphoto | A young grizzly bear in Alaska’s Denali National Park stands against a backdrop of bright fall colors, feasting on blueberries to fatten up for a long winter hibernation. The taiga where this bear roams turns into a stunning canvas of reds and oranges each September, thanks to a unique mix of dwarf birch, willows, and blueberry bushes. Lasting only from late August to October, Denali’s autumn is brief but unforgettable, especially for photographers! For more scenes from this extraordinary landscape, follow @argonautphoto.
