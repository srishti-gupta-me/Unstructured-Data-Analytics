The unknown mummy originates from the KV21 tomb located in the Valley of the Kings. Discovered in 1817 by Italian archaeologist and explorer Giovanni Belzoni and later re-excavated in the 1980s by American archaeologist Donald P. Ryan, the tomb contained another mummy, KV21A. Both are believed to be queens from the 18th dynasty. Researchers are conducting further analysis, including DNA samples and CT scans, to determine their origin and family tree.
