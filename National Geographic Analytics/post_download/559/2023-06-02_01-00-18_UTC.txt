Photo by @beverlyjoubert |There is no safer haven for an elephant calf. Few dangers can reach it here, nestled under its mother’s protective underbelly and encircled by the additional bulwark of the herd. And as the calf grows, the herd will continue to be a source of guidance, wisdom, and support. From lessons on foraging techniques and migratory routes to playful interactions and complex communication, from cultural learning to gentle companionship, all of this can be found within the embrace of the herd. Observing elephants in Botswana’s Okavango Delta, one of the last major strongholds for the species, it's impossible not to sense their deep-rooted connections and interdependence.
