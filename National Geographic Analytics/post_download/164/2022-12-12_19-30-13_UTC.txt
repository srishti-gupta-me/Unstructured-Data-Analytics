Photo by David Chancellor @chancellordavid | I’ve had a lot of time this past week to sit and think. I’ve been playing hide-and-seek with an Arabian leopard cub in Taif, Saudi Arabia. She’s shy, and something deep inside me hopes that will always be the case.

I’m not a wildlife photographer. I don’t have the patience to sit for hours, days, or months in order to get that shot. What’s brought me here is the birth of this cub and the significance of it in terms of human-wildlife coexistence. I’m here to bear witness to the reinstatement of wildlife and ecosystems that man’s very presence has previously destroyed. A powerful symbol of the restoration and regeneration of the country’s natural landscape is the Arabian leopard. Amal (“hope”) is one of two cubs born recently at the breeding center here in Taif. The goal is that, in the not too distant future, she will contribute to the rewilding of this landscape when these truly majestic cats are reintroduced back into their rightful position as apex predators. A lot of work will need to be done before that happens, but what we see here is an enormously bright light by which progress can be illuminated. To see more follow me @chancellordavid.
