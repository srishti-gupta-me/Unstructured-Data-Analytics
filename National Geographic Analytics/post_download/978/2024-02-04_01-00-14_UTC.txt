Photo by @joelsartore | Meet Trompie, a 5-month-old northern tamandua in Costa Rica's Las Pumas Rescue Center and Sanctuary. Strange looks work to this species' advantage in its forest-and-scrub habitat, where it spends most of the day sleeping in trees, then venturing onto the ground at night in search of food. Tamanduas have a long, prehensile (grasping) tail that can be used as an extra hand or foot while climbing trees, and a specialized mouth and tongue allow these guys to consume up to 9,000 ants a day. The purpose of that thick, kinky hair? To protect tamanduas from being bitten by angry ants as they dine! To see more species featured in the Photo Ark, follow me, @joelsartore.
