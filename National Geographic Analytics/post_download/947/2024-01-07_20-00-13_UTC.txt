Photo by @joelsartore | In the wild, gray gibbons call the rainforests on the island of Borneo home. They are exclusively arboreal, meaning they spend almost all of their time in the trees, trying to never let their feet touch the ground. While this might seem impossible, it is actually quite easy for gibbons thanks to their extra-long arms! This species uses those lanky forelimbs for brachiation, a form of movement in which primates swing from tree limb to tree limb using only their arms. Without forests full of tall trees in close proximity to one another, gibbons are unable to move within their home range, meaning they struggle to find the food and shelter they need to survive.
