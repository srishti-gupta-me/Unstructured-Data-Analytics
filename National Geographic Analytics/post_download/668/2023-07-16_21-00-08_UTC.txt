Comment which spider you think is the black widow and read the full story at the link in bio for the answer.

The world of bugs is filled with lookalike species! False widow spiders resemble their infamous cousins, black widow spiders—but pack a much less potent bite. Like black widows, these species have markings on their abdomen, though not as bright red or as distinctive as the black widow’s classic hourglass shape. The false widow is just one example of how nature has evolved lookalikes that can make it tough for people to tell one bug apart from another.
