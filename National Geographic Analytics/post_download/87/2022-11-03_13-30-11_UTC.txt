Photo by @paoloverzone | Mostafa Waziri, the head of Egyptâ€™s Supreme Council of Antiquities, examines a colorfully painted wooden sarcophagus at the archaeological area of Saqqara, 20 miles (around 30 km) south of Cairo. The ancient Egyptian relic, used to store the guts of the deceased, dates back to 600 B.C. When the pandemic kept most foreign archaeologists at home, Waziri hired locals to carry on the work and in doing so greatly increased the number of digs overseen by Egyptians.
