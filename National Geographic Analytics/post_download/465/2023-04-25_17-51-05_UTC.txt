Photo by Javier Aznar @javier_aznar_photography | Located in Tucson, Arizona, Saguaro National Park is one of the most unique parks in the U.S. The first time I came close to a saguaro cactus—which commonly grows as high as 40 feet (12 meters)—I felt overwhelmed by its size. I came here to photograph the unique wildlife of this extreme habitat, but what captured my attention was the landscape filled with chollas and saguaros, their spines glowing as the sun slid down the horizon. | For #NationalParkWeek, @GMC encourages you to explore and find your nowhere by visiting one of your local natural wonders.
