Photo by Michael Yamashita @yamashitaphoto | The Tokaido Shinkansen is one of the busiest high-speed train lines in the world, connecting Japan’s three largest metropolitan areas—Tokyo-Yokohama, Nagoya, and Osaka—and departing every few minutes during peak travel times. The Shinkansen introduced the world to modern high-speed rail travel. I photographed the train from this angle after scouting out locations for a book on the world’s greatest train rides. Pictured here, the Shinkansen zooms past towering Mount Fuji, the highest mountain in Japan, at upwards of 200 mph (320 kph). Along its route, the train snakes through some of Japan’s most iconic scenery, including tea country and the Pacific coast. Before the Shinkansen, a conventional train took six and a half hours to complete the trip. Now the latest N700 trains can do it in as little as two and a half hours. | Adobe @lightroom gives beginner and professional photographers easy tools to edit their photos, no matter where they are.
