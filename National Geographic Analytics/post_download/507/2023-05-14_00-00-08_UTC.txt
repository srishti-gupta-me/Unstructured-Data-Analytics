Photo by Orsolya Haarberg @fjellheimengalleri | The arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) was the only land mammal in Iceland when human settlers arrived a little over a thousand years ago. It has two distinct color morphs: the “white,” which turns white in winter, and the “blue,” which remains brown year-round. The blue fox’s coat in Iceland’s northwest provides camouflage among volcanic rocks and on the dark sand shoreline but is easy to spot in a snowfield.
