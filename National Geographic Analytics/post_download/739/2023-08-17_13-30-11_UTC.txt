Photo by @maggiesteber | Robb and Alesia Stubblefield hug daughter Katie, a few months after her face transplant in Cleveland. Katie attempted suicide when she was 18 years old after a heartbreak. She put the barrel of a rifle below her chin and pulled the trigger, destroying the front of her face and damaging her vision. When I met Katie and her family, she had gone through multiple surgeries for several years. Her parents quit their teaching jobs to care for her. Every day was spent at doctor’s offices.

Katie was always in pain. Her parents were always at her side to fight for her to receive the best treatments. Cleveland Clinic was paying for all of Katie’s medical care, as she was the youngest face-transplant candidate it had seen. Working with her might move the science of face transplants forward. Only National Geographic magazine would give us three years to work with such a fragile story in order to make honest, intimate, and informative photographs.

Finally a face became available for Katie. A young woman her age went into a coma from a drug overdose. Her grandmother donated her granddaughter’s face to Katie. It was a chance for Katie and her parents to move forward. Over time, watching Robb and Alesia so closely, I thought of them as eagles, their wings spread flying over the nest of their young one, protecting and encouraging her, and believing this day would come. They were warriors for their daughter. I hoped this photograph would show their love, faith, grief, determination, and strength that comes from the deepest devotion.
