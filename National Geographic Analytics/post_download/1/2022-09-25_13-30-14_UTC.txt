Photo by @estherhorvath | Moss-covered trees and dead wood in the logging-free “core zone” of Germany’s Black Forest National Park. Old firs, beeches, and spruces appear along the Wildnispfades (“wilderness path”) in the northern part of the park. This photo was taken for a story featured in Nat Geo’s September issue, “Meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.” Please follow @estherhorvath for more stories.
