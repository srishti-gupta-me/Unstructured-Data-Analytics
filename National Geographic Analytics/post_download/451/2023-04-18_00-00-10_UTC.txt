Photo by @danwintersphoto | The SpaceX Starship with its Super Heavy booster, a combined 400-foot vehicle, awaits its first orbital attempt in Boca Chica, Texas. The first try was scrubbed Monday, April 17, because of a last-minute issue with pressurization. The next attempt will be later this week. If successful, this launch will get us one step closer to landing humans on the lunar surface again, as NASA plans to use a modified version of Starship for the planned Artemis III mission that will launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida by 2030.
