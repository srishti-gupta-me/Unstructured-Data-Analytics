Photo by @paoloverzone | In East Greenland, a polar bear traverses the frozen sea. Due to global warming, over the past four decades the Arctic has warmed at a rate nearly four times faster than the rest of the planet, causing the sea ice to dissolve rapidly. The situation forces polar bears to relocate to the mainland, facing limited feeding prospects. Follow @paoloverzone for more images and stories.
