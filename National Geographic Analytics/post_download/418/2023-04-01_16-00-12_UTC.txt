Photo by @lynseyaddario | Achiek Abach, 35, is rolled onto his side by his siblings and others as he struggles with malaria in Dhiam Dhiam, South Sudan, on October 26, 2021. That year parts of South Sudan experienced some of the worst flooding in six decades, exacerbating most of the illnesses commonly seen and transmitted in the rainy season: malaria, acute respiratory infections, and diarrhea. Entire swaths and villages of Jonglei state, where Dhiam Dhiam is located, were completely submerged. The reasons are various but boil down to a combination of climate change, deforestation in neighboring Ethiopia, population growth, and poor water management across Africa, experts say. The flooding continued into 2022. Photographed with a grant from @insidenatgeo. For more on this story, go to the link in bio.
