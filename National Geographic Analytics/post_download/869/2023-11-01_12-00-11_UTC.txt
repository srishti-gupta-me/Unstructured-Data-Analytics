Celebrated all over the world, El Día de los Muertos (the Day of the Dead) is a Mexican holiday in which people remember their ancestors. Many build altars, or ofrendas, to honor them, and ply them with items such as the deceased person’s favorite food. La Calavera Catrina originated from an etching by Mexican illustrator José Guadalupe Posada in the early 20th century. The etching satirizes the country’s elite just before the Mexican revolution. La Catrina is a popular costume tied to El Día de los Muertos and central to Mexican identity.
