Photo by @michaelchristopherbrown | This photograph was made during the February 2013 nor'easter, also known as winter storm Nemo, as I wandered through Central Park. New York City was a home base from 2005 to 2017. And while all cities are unique and special in their own way, living in here in my 20s and 30s was magical. The experience recalls what Hemingway wrote about Paris: “If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.”
