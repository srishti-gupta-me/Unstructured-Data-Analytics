Photo by @mattiasklumofficial | India is a country of roughly 1.4 billion, with a population density of at least 400 inhabitants per square kilometer. Yet amazingly enough, they've been able to save their country's own version of the "big five": the Bengal tiger, Asiatic lion, Indian elephant, Indian rhino, and leopard. 

India launched Project Tiger back in 1973, and the country has 53 tiger reserves, including Kanha National Park where this picture was taken. Tiger numbers are increasing in South Asia, not only in India but in Nepal and Bhutan as well. Populations are considered stable in the Russian Far East and in areas along the Russia-China border. In Southeast Asia, though, the situation is much worse, with the species having been lost from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam around the turn of the century.
