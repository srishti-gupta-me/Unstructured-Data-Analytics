Photo by @rubensalgadoescudero | A monk prays at Kyaiktiyo Pagoda, also known as Golden Rock, the third most important Buddhist pilgrimage site in Myanmar. Standing at the top of Mount Kyaiktiyo, Golden Rock is a small temple built on a granite boulder. The boulder is covered with gold leaves, which devotees paste onto the surface before praying. 

I was supposed to go to Myanmar for one month in 2013. When I arrived, I immediately became enamored with the country and its people. I ended up staying for two and a half years. It is where I began my journey as a professional photographer.
