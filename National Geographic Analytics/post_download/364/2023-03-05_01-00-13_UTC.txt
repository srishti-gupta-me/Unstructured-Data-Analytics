Photo by @martinschoeller | In 2022 I began a series photographing and sharing the experiences of Native peoples in America. The portraits were taken at the Gathering of Nations, the largest powwow in North America. This is Jessica R. Bojorquez of California's La Jolla Band of Luiseño Indians: 

“I learned later on in life that I was Native. My parents didn’t tell us, because back in the day—my grandparents’ generation—it was even worse to be Native than it was to be Black in Southern California. Natives weren't allowed in town; we had bounties on our heads. A lot of Natives transferred over to the Spanish side [Mexico]. They went across the border and portrayed themselves as Mexicans—that way they could go into town and buy things and not be killed, in other words."
