Photo by @javier_aznar_photography | A red-eyed dwarf iguana (Enyalioides oshaughnessyi) rests on a tree at night in  Ecuador's protected Choc√≥ rainforest. The vulnerable species is endemic to this lowland rainforest and the adjacent Andean foothills. Nonprofit organizations like @fcat_ecuador are vital to the restoration and protection of these last remains of primeval forest in Ecuador, where thousands of species are threatened by habitat loss.
