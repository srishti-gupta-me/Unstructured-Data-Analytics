Scientists have cleared a significant hurdle in the years-long effort to save Africaâ€™s northern white rhinoceros from extinction with the first-ever rhino pregnancy using in vitro fertilization. The lab-assisted pregnancy involved implanting a southern white rhino embryo in a surrogate mother named Curra.

The surrogate mother died three months into her 16-month pregnancy from an unrelated bacterial infection, but the successful embryo transfer and early stages of pregnancy pave the way for next applying the technique to the critically endangered northern white rhino. Learn more at the link in bio.
