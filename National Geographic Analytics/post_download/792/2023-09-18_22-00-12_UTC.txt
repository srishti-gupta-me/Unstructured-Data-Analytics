Photo by @kiliiiyuyan | I'm on assignment on the Ningaloo Reef, in the sparkling waters off Western Australia. It's one of those times when I'm actually doing what my friends think I do all the time: swimming with whale sharks and diving over reefs of red coral and giant fish. This is a fringing reef with nutrients from an offshore upwelling, which attracts everything up to Ningaloo's charismatic big three: humpbacks, whale sharks, and manta rays. Thanks to protections from UNESCO and a dedicated local community, 45,000 humpbacks migrate through each year, and you can be in the water as they cruise by or—for the adventurous—feel small swimming next to a whale shark.
