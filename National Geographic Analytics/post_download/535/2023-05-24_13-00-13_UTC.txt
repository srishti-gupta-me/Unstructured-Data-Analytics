Photo by @martinedstrom | These wolf cubs photographed in Sjunda, Sweden, just outside of Stockholm, symbolize one side of a hotly debated topic among Nordics: wolf conservation. The survival of these cubs and their pack represents a massive victory for some, but the predators, which have been known to attack livestock, are hated by others.
