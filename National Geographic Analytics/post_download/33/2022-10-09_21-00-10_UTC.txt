Photo by @estherhorvath | Biologist Nicole Ottawa and photographer Oliver Meckes, along with ranger Charly Ebel (in green), collect moss, slime mold, and other organisms from dead wood in the “core zone” of Germany’s Black Forest National Park. The samples are then photographed using a scanning electron microscope in Ottawa and Meckes’s lab, part of their Eye of Science project. Please follow @estherhorvath for more stories. This photo was taken on assignment for National Geographic’s September issue: “Meet the marvelous creatures that bring soil to life.”
