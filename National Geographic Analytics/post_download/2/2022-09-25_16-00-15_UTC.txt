Photo by @beverlyjoubert | My, what teeth you have… No doubt it’s an impressive set, but unfortunately for the cheetah, not as impressive as it could be. These high-speed hunters pay an evolutionary price for their agility. Because they require large nasal passages to deliver the oxygen needed to power their impressive sprints, cheetahs are left with far less room in the skull to accommodate big teeth. Being light and lithe for maximum speed also makes them vulnerable to meal theft by larger predators like lions, leopards, and hyenas. It’s not easy being the fastest cat on the block.
