For nearly four centuries until around A.D. 1600, a community of Icelanders on the west coast buried their dead on the tiny island of Haffjarðarey. Centuries later, waves and rising sea levels began to expose bones eroding from the island cemetery. Archaeologists excavating this ancient cemetery in 1945 found only bodies—a Harvard University-sponsored scientific expedition showed up earlier and removed the skulls.

Today, the missing crania sit in cardboard boxes on steel storage shelves in a Harvard museum basement. There’s interest by researchers in both Iceland and the U.S. to reunite the skulls with the rest of their bodies that are located at the National Museum of Iceland in Reykjavik. It’s not only good science, archaeologists argue, but also the morally and ethically right thing to do.
