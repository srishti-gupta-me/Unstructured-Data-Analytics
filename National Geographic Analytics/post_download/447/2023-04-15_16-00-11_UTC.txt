Photo by @jenguyton | This Earth Month, I’m thinking about all the incredible young Mozambican conservationists I have met. Here, wildlife veterinarian Mércia Ângela takes her daily walk with Boogli, a female Cape pangolin. Gorongosa National Park’s law enforcement team confiscated Boogli, along with a leopard skin, as a 2.2 kilogram (5 lb) infant; Boogli’s mother had already been sold. Mércia was one of Boogli’s caregivers, working with her every day as she was raised to adulthood. A few weeks after I shot this photo, Boogli was released back into the wild. 

The Gorongosa team now rescues pangolins from all over central Mozambique, rehabilitating them as needed, then releasing them. Pangolins are the world’s most trafficked mammal, as many people wrongly believe their scales have medicinal value. In reality their scales are just made of keratin, the same material as our hair and fingernails. The passion and optimism of young conservationists like Mércia give me great hope that Mozambique will continue to protect and revive the country’s irreplaceable wildernesses! #EarthMonth
