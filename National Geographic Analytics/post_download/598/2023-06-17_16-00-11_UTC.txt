She swam 4 to 6 hours each day over a month as part of what she calls the Agbetsi Living Water Swim project, which focuses on textile waste in the country.

The expedition built on research into the environmental impact of textiles flowing through Ghana, one of the largest importers of secondhand clothing in the world. The Or Foundation estimates that weekly Ghana sees 15 million items of used clothing or cast-off inventory from the EU, the U.K., and the U.S. entering Accra's Kantamanto Market, where 30,000 traders sort through their purchased bales for items they can re-sell or upcycle. But today on average 40% of every clothing bale is deemed too cheap or poor quality to re-use—a trend tracking the rise of fast fashion—and it's discarded and sent to landfills. The waste has reached a tipping point; it eventually ends up on the shores of waterways, often washed down by rains, bringing with it an enormous environmental toll as well as upheaval for the local garment industry.
