Photo by @stephsinclairpix @tooyoungtowed | To draw attention to the dramatic deterioration of girlsâ€™ rights and gender equality around the world, I'm sharing the story of Irene, 15, who is one of the millions of girls whose lives were forever altered as a result of the prolonged school closures tied to COVID-19. Here, Irene is getting her baby examined at a local hospital in North Pokot Sub-county, Kenya. 

Reports of gender-based violence in Kenya increased by 92% between January and June 2020, compared to the same timeframe in 2019. Complications arising from pregnancy and childbirth, particularly among FGM (female genital mutilation) survivors, are a leading cause of death among adolescent girls in developing countries, and the risk of maternal mortality is five times higher for girls under 15 years of age, according to the  WHO.
