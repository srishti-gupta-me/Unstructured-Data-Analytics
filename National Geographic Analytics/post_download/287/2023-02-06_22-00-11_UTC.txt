Kingfishers, despite being exquisitely handsome, are born blind, bald, and ugly—recalling the ugly duckling story. Mum and dad feed the chicks all day long for nearly a month, catching small fish along the river and bringing them back to the nest—a tunnel dug into the bank, with a small chamber at the end. Inside, it's almost completely dark, so the parents work by touch to find an open beak, stuffing in a fish headfirst. Successful broods will fledge between six and eight chicks.
