Photo by @kiliiiyuyan | I’m on assignment in Greenland, where narwhals come when the sea ice retreats to feed and give birth to their calves deep in fjords. The light was golden around midnight during the 24-hour daylight of polar summer. 

Narwhals have been hunted by the Inughuit here for millennia, and today hunters continue the tradition within a quota management system designed to ensure the narwhal population remains healthy. The region’s wildlife is prolific due to both excellent management and an open-water area fed by currents and upwelling known as the North Water Polynya. The polynya creates an incredible habitat for narwhals and walruses as well as the polar bears and people that depend on them.  Follow me @kiliiiyuyan for more from the Arctic and beyond.
