Photo by @amivitale | In the early morning hours, a wild giraffe visits Reteti Elephant Sanctuary, in northern Kenya. While known for its work with elephants, @r.e.s.c.u.e also helps care for orphaned rhinos, giraffes, and others. It has released a number of orphaned giraffes back into the wild, and they do come back to visit from time to time. Follow @amivitale to learn more, including how to help. #giraffe #conservation #kenya #africa #babyanimals
