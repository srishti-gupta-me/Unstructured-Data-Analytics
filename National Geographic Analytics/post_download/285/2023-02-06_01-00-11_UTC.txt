Although sea otters are generalists when it comes to feeding, they often prefer specific foods. As conditions change and the sea gets rougher, otters will still forage in very shallow waters when the seas are high. 

As excellent swimmers capable of holding their breath for nearly 8 minutes, otters can stay below the heavy waves until smaller sets of waves come in or until they can swim to deeper waters.
