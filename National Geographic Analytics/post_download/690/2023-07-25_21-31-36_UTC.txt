Photo by @rubensalgadoescudero | Jacob Dove Basker aka Jake the Rapper, 51, originally is from New York City, but Germany has been home for 30 years. He's one of Berlin’s legendary DJs and producers, as well as a father of two children with his wife. In 2021, Berlin became the first city in the world to officially recognize nightclubs as cultural institutions. As such, the selected venues benefit from tax breaks and protection from displacement. Previously, only theaters, opera houses, museums, and concert halls held this status. 

In Berlin Jake has made a name for himself not only in the music scene but also as an articulate voice in the community he cherishes for its equalizing power. "Here everyone’s equal and everyone has a right to be there. The guy who’s cleaning the toilet can still be the DJ," he says. "There’s no elite group or bottle service. The door can never cost 50 euro. It’ll never be that way because it goes against the basic principles they [club scene] have." Follow me on @rubensalgadoescudero to see the world through my lens.
