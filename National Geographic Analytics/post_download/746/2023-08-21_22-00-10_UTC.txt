Photo by Luján Agusti @lujanag | In Argentina's Tierra del Fuego, I was on assignment to document the long-established Baqueanos family, who work the land, raise cattle, and love horses. People in the Tierra del Fuego often have a deep bond with the land they live on. It's a harsh and unforgiving territory, but it's also a place of great beauty and abundance. The Baqueanos have learned to live in harmony with it, and their horses are their essential partners.

A gaucho (cowboy) knows the cycles of the animals and the land like few others do. Spending time with Alvino “El Chino” Velázquez was surprising and enriching. This portrait was taken at the end of yerra, an annual event in which the foals are branded and the needs of each of the horses are attended to. It's always done in December, when the days are long and there are only a few hours of darkness. At this late time of night, the horses had returned to their forest home and all was quiet.
