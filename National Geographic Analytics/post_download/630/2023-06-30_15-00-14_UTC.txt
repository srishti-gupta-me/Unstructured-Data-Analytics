He bathes after a long day of trekking in extreme heat. All freshened up, we sit under a tree. Haider explains his mission: “My ultimate challenge is to kill off my desires. I must control my eyes, my mouth, and my ego. There is nothing without sacrifice.” Head over to National Geographic's YouTube channel to watch a short documentary, “Lahooti,” focusing on the journey of these pilgrims.
