Photo by @amivitale | Wildlife keeper Lekupania receives a nuzzle from an orphaned giraffe at @sararafoundation on Namunyak Wildlife Sanctuary in northern Kenya. A Samburu warrior, Lekupania used to look after his familyâ€™s livestock until he become an animal whisperer. He saved Fupi, the giraffe in this photograph, who had been injured after falling into a ditch. Since then, Fupi has been rehabilitated and returned to the wild by Lekupania, along with a number of other giraffes. Now all the rehabilitated giraffes come every morning to check on Lekupania. They do rounds of the stables and greet him, then make their way back to the wild. Follow @sararafoundation, @r.e.s.c.u.e, and @amivitale to learn more, including how to help ongoing conservation efforts. Stay tuned for more images of love celebrating #valentinesday. #giraffe #conservation #kenya #africa #babyanimals #kisses
