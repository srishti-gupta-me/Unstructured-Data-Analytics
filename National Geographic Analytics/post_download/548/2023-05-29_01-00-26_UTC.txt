Until about 10 years ago, this fjord froze over regularly in winter and you could cross it on skis or snowmobile. That's no longer possible: Svalbard is at the epicenter of global warming, where the average winter temperature has risen by about 7 degrees Celsius over the past three decades—as observed by atmospheric measurements at AWIPEV.
