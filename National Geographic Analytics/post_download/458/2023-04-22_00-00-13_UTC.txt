Photo by David Guttenfelder @dguttenfelder | The sun sets over Lake Superiorâ€™s York Island, one of the 21 islands that make up the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, seen from the grounds of Raspberry Island lighthouse. The archipelago, which is Ojibwe Native land and the heart of the Anishinaabe story of creation, has been a protected national lakeshore since 1970. The name for the Apostle Islands in Ojibwe is Wenabozho Ominisan. According to the National Park Service, this translates to a possessive relationship between the cultural hero Wenabozho and his ownership of the islands, since he is the one who made them.
