Photo by @javier_aznar_photography | An Ecuadorian hillstar (Oreotrochilus chimborazo) naps while perched on a Chuquiragua, one of the flowers they feed on. Each night this species of hummingbird enters a state of torpor, a kind of temporary hibernation in which its heart rate and vital functions dramatically slow to help it withstand the cold of the high Andes.
