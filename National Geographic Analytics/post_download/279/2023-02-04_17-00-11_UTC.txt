Photo by @javier_aznar_photography | A tent-making bat (Uroderma bilobatum) drinks water from a pond in the Ecuadorian Amazon. In this single frame, I used a flash on stroboscopic mode, lighting the bat three times in this sequence. Bats are invaluable for their ecological services: they disperse seeds, pollinate flowers, and feed on millions of insects, potentially limiting the spread of some viral diseases.
