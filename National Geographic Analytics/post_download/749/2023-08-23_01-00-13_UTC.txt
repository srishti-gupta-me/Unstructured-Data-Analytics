Photo by @chrisburkard | I find landscapes inspiring but also our interaction with them beautiful and worthy of documentation. On a cold night in 2015, Stellisee, a lake in Zermatt, Switzerland, seemed like the perfect place to capture the Milky Way juxtaposed with a single viewer. A notable lack of wind allowed for a reflection to emerge, providing the moment I was looking forâ€”and one I hoped others would imagine themselves in when seeing the photo.
