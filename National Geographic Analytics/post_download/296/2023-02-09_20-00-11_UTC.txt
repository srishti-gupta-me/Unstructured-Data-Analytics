Photo by @isadorakosofsky | Jeanie Thompson, 81, and Will Seward, 84, kiss on the sidewalk in Los Angeles. Jeanie and Will met at a retirement community in East Hollywood. But this photograph tells only one part of their story. In 2011 Will was evicted from a retirement community where he shared an apartment with Adina, a longtime companion. He moved into another assisted-living community nearby, where he met Jeanie. They connected immediately. Torn between Adina and Jeanie, Will tried to maintain a relationship with both. Eventually, after a period of discomfort, conflict, and uncertainty, Jeanie and Adina accepted the unconventional dynamic. “There are many different kinds of love,” said Adina. Jeanie, Will, and Adina formed a trio, often spending days roaming around the east side of Los Angeles. Their relationship challenged sociocultural norms and stereotypes about how older adults should live their lives. More than anything, their time together revealed ageless questions about freedom, romantic love, the nature of intimacy, and what constitutes a relationship.

In honor of Valentine's Day, we are posting images about love in its many forms. #ValentinesDay
