Photo by Javier Aznar @javier_aznar_photography | This portrait of a chachi tree frog (Boana picturata) was photographed in the Ecuadorian Chocó. Although the species is common in some areas, there is little data about it. A recent study that called the frog "an underexplored source of bioactive peptides" found three new antimicrobial peptide families in the skin secretions of the frog—a reminder that we must protect its habitat. As we bring many animals to extinction, we are destroying opportunities to find cures for diseases such as cancer and to discover new antibiotics for multiresistant bacteria among other substances. 

Thanks to nonprofits such as @fundacion.jocotoco, this region of Ecuador and the species that inhabit it have a chance to survive. Follow @javier_aznar_photography to discover some of the animals in the rainforests of South America. #ecuador #frog #animals #wildebeest
