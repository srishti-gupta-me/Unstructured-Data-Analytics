Photo by @joelsartore | For their first couple years of life, juvenile Peruvian spider monkeys like this one @rarec.center depend heavily on their mothers for everything from protection and transportation to vital nutrients obtained through momâ€™s milk. Once weaned, these primates will become important gardeners of their forested homes, consuming more than 130 species of fruit and dispersing the seeds. To see more species featured in the Photo Ark, follow me @joelsartore. #monkey #primate #animal #wildlife #PhotoArk
