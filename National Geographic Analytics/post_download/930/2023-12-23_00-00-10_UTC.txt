Photo by @joelsartore | Kagus like this duo are rare, flightless birds that call the forests of New Caledonia, a French overseas territory in the southwestern Pacific, home. Those wings may seem oversized for a bird that doesnâ€™t fly, but they serve an important role. When a potential predator is nearby, parents will flap their fully opened wings on the ground, as if injured, to turn attention away from their chick.
