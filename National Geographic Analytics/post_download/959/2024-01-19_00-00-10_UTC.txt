Photo by @chrisburkard | Within the shadow of the sentinels in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, an entire ecosystem flourishes on the tree trunks and the forest floor. The sequoias themselves are remarkably resilient, adapted to endure fires that periodically sweep through the Sierra Nevada, relying on their thick, fire-resistant bark for protection. These ancient trees, reaching for the heavens, bear witness to hundreds of years of change and history in the area and are now safely conserved in the national parks. This image was captured while I was on an assignment in the fall of 2023 for Nat Geo.
