Photo by Robin Hammond @hammond_robin | In many countries around the world June is Pride month. It's a time for LGBTQI+ people to celebrate and be celebrated by their communities. But life for many continues to be hard. When I met Julian, he was homeless. Growing up in a Mormon family, Julian was surrounded by gender stereotypes. He says, “I realized the most authentic part of myself was a boy.” Like so many transgender people, Julian has faced discrimination and homelessness. Despite it all, he is inspired by a Mormon principle to “hope to endure all things.” As with many of those I photographed for @whereloveisillegal, Julian chose not to reveal his identity. For a lot of participants in this project, being identified as gay, lesbian, or trans can result in rejection, hate, and violence. Up to a third of LGBTQI+ youth in America have reported experiencing homelessness or housing instability at some point in their lives, according to a survey from the Trevor Project. The Pride movement is built on a tradition of protest, outrage, and a hunger for equality. Follow me for more.
