White Sands contains the largest gypsum dunefield in the world, including hearth mounds—remains of prehistoric campfires found nowhere else. The park is also home to the largest collection of fossilized footprints, from the Ice Age, and tells the story of potentially more than 20,000 years of human presence. Some believe the footprints challenge scientists’ timeline of when humans first came to North America. 

An ancient sea once covered most of the southwestern United States. During that time, layers of gypsum were deposited on the seafloor. The rise and fall of sea levels millions of years ago initiated the process of making gypsum sand. More recently, astronauts have used this slice of desert, over 275 square miles (700 sq km), as a geographic reference point. I've been atop these unique dunes many times as a photographer; the park is a refuge where one cannot help but feel the presence of generations of seekers and storytellers before us.
