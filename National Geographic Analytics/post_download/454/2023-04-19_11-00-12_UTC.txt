Photo by @estherhorvath | Warming four times as fast as the rest of the planet, the Arctic can be considered the epicenter of global warmingâ€”where changes are visible. Kronebreen is one of the fastest retreating glaciers in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. Over the last 15 years, the glacier has retreated about four kilometers (2.5 miles). Even mapping has not yet caught up: When I visited the area with scientists, the GPS showed that our boat was on top of the glacier, but in fact its edge was still two kilometers away.
