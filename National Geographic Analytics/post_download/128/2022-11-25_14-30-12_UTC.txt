Photo by @sofia_jaramillo5 | Idaho is the 14th largest state by total area and has more than 25,000 farms that account for nearly 20 percent of the stateâ€™s economic output, including potatoes, wheat, sugar beets, and more. When I drive around my home in southeast Idaho, I love seeing the juxtaposition of the fall leaves and the farmers gathering their crops after a long summer.
