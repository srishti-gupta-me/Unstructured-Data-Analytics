Photo by @ismailferdous | On a recent spring day, a group of young Jewish adults gathered for a barbecue picnic at Prospect Park in Brooklyn, New York. They had come from all over the United States, some even from Canada, but now they call Brooklyn home. The air was filled with the sound of sizzling meat, the smell of charcoal, and the hum of laughter and conversation. As they grilled and feasted on delicious food, they shared stories about their diverse Jewish backgrounds and experiences and discovered common threads that bound them together.
