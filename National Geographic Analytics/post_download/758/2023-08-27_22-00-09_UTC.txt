Photo by Charlie Hamilton James @chamiltonjames | I was in Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park shooting a story on vultures and knew I needed an image that classically represented both the beauty and the grotesque. Photographing the vultures as they frenzied over a carcass was chaotic and fast, and I found it hard to really grasp the essence of who the birds were and what was going on. One evening while going through my day’s photos at camp, I noticed a drop of blood falling from a vulture’s beak. The image was bad, but I saw something in it. Over the next three weeks, I focused my attention on capturing a drop of blood and eventually, after tens of thousands of images, got this split second. I often find that the early stages of a shoot are about learning; the rest is about refining.
