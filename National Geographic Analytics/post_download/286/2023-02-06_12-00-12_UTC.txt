Photo by Pete McBride @pedromcbride | A study in layers: The Grand Canyon's Bright Angel Trail descends 4,380 feet (1,335 m) from the 270 million-year-old Kaibab Formation to the 1.7-billion-year-old Zoroaster Granite on the river. Formed on the ocean floor, the Kaibab Limestone is the canyon's uppermost layer, sitting around 9,000 feet (2,700 m) in elevation due to the plate tectonics that uplifted the Colorado Plateau.
