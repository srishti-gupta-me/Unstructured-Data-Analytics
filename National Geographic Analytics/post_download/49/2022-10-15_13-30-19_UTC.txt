Photo by @katieorlinsky // This is my three-year-old dog Goose chasing sticks in the Red Hook Channel, New York. My partner and I live between Brooklyn, New York and Richmond, Virginia, and three years ago we adopted Goose from a Virginia shelter. They had rented out an empty storefront and filled it with adorable, adoptable puppies, all of which thankfully found loving homes. One of those pups was a chubby little three-month-old hound mix with dirt on his nose, spots on his ears, and soulful eyes. He slept on my lap the whole car ride home. He remained a sleepy, snuggly puppy for about 24 more hours, and then it was go time! Goose loves action, whatever it may be—playing with other dogs, fetch, running. Most of all, he loves it when all of these things can happen in water. Goose loves to swim, but he wasn’t always so comfortable in water. We first tried to teach him to swim in a pool, but he couldn't figure out the stairs. We had to carry him in. Then he couldn’t get enough. Lakes, streams, even the ocean—Goose goes right in! Watching him swim still makes me feel super proud and inspires me to be brave and overcome my own fears. // Dogs make the world a better place.
