Photo by Aaron Huey @argonautphoto | This post honors Karma Tsering Sherpa (1930-2023), who I was lucky enough to spend some time with while working on a story about Sherpas for the magazine in 2013. Karma was known and loved by many of us in the photographic community. I learned of his passing when his grandson, Pemba, announced that, as his Buddhist faith teaches, the spirit of Karma had completed the 49th day seeking a rebirth in a journey after life into a new existence. 

It reminded me of his mantra. He'd recite it on our many walks and in his home, day and night (almost inaudibly but still incessantly). With these six syllables, he hoped he and all other living beings would be released from the cycle of suffering that is birth, death, and rebirth: â€œOm mani padme hum, om mani padme hum, om mani padme hum... " 

To the people of Nepal's Khumbu Valley, each syllable is its own powerful prayer. The syllables represent a release from different realms of suffering: "Om" for ego and pride, "ma" for jealousy, "ni" for passion and desire, "pad" for ignorance and prejudice, "me" for greed and possessiveness, and "hum" (sometimes "hung") for hatred and aggression.

And so, asked for or not, Karma prayed for all of us climbers wandering through his Himalayan backyard, reciting the mantra thousands of times a day, counting each on a long string of beads, like all the elders of the valley do. In the Khumbu you cannot avoid ceremony, even if you wanted to. The air is full of prayers and sacred smoke. It's inhaled and cleans you out without express permission; you are blessed for just having walked there. Now, after his 49 days of seeking, Karma is reborn. We celebrate you, Karma!
