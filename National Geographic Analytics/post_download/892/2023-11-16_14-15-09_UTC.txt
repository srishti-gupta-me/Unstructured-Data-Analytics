Photo by @mattiasklumofficial | Two baby elephants cuddle in front of my camera in Tanzania’s Selous Game Reserve. Young elephants spend a lot of time playing by chasing and pulling each other’s tails. They splash and spray with water and mud, and they often “trunk wrestle” and practice fighting in pushing-and-pulling competitions. Please follow @mattiasklumofficial for more images and conservation stories from my projects around the world.
