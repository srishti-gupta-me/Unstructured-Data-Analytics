Photo by Orsolya Haarberg @fjellheimengalleri | A high-altitude view of northern Swedenâ€™s Sarek National Park shows mountain hills and valleys covered with birches. These trees are scraggly, crooked, and extremely hardy. In September, when the first frosts arrive, the forest seems to be on fire with bright colors from the tree leaves. But overnight a storm can blow them away, leaving the woods naked and gray. Please follow @fjellheimengalleri for more images, primarily from the Nordic countries. #sarek #rapadelta #nammatj #landscapephotography #autumn #sweden #birchforest
