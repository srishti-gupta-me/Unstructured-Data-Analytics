From before the rise of Athens to the height of the Roman Empire, one of the most sought-after products in the Mediterranean world was a golden-flowered plant called silphion. It cured diseases and made food tasty, but Emperor Nero allegedly consumed the last stalk. Since the Middle Ages, botanical explorers inspired by ancient accounts of this miracle plant have sought it on three continents, and always in vain. Many historians view its disappearance as the first recorded extinction of any species, plant or animal. But is silphion truly extinct? Thanks to a lucky encounter almost 40 years ago—and decades of subsequent research—a professor at Istanbul University suspects it's not.
