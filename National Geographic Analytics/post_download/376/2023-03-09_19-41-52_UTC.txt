Photo by @yagazieemezi | Two members of Mavula Sape strike a pose in the trunk of an old taxi in their neighborhood of Mikalu in Brazzaville, Congo. Even without a camera pointed at them, the sapeuses maintain fashionable stances, almost as if they are silently competing with each other. Their individual personas are defined by their unique style and flair, and some are known by their clothing colors, walks, hairstyles, and even exaggerated facial expressions. Mavula Sape is part of SAPE (Société des Ambianceurs et des Personnes Élégantes, or Society of Tastemakers and Elegant People), a subculture that can be traced back to the 1920s, when young men, as a form of protest against French-colonial powers, adopted the clothing of their “masters” and created their own unique styles. While the men, the sapeurs, have gained international recognition over the years with their dapper and colorful suits, the women (sapeuses) were not as well-known despite having embraced the culture for decades. Women supporting women—whether enjoying a spectacle of expression or engaging in local services provided by women—foster independence of spirit and self. | Global #logistics brand @dhl_global is supporting the SheTrades Program, amplifying cultural and social movements across the globe and encouraging female entrepreneurs to play a bigger role in society and the economy.
