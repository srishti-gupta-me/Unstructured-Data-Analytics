Photo by @amivitale | A keeper does an evening check on Najin and Fatu at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in northern Kenya. Najin and Fatu are the last two northern white rhinos on the planet, and they're cared for 24 hours a day, seven days a week, by devoted keepers. These men spend more time with these rhinos than they do their own families. The bonds are deep, and the keepers have a profound understanding of just how precious these last northern white rhinos are. 

I've recently launched the short film “Remembering Sudan,” which documents the incredible work of Zacharia Mutai and all of the keepers and rangers who sacrifice so much to protect these creatures, including Sudan, the sole northern white rhino male. He passed away in 2018. The keepers have a profound commitment and a heavy responsibility knowing the rhinos are the last of their kind.
