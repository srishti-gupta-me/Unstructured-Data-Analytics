Photo by @acacia.johnson | Pilot Jamie Klaes, photographed here with her Cessna 182 in Anchorage, Alaska, is from Bettles, a small village 35 miles north of the Arctic Circle. She says that growing up, flying was as normal as driving a car—essential for getting groceries or medical care. Much of the state is inaccessible by road, and dozens of its remote settlements, predominantly Alaska Native communities, depend on planes as a mode of transport. Today Klaes teaches intensive aviation courses to rural Alaskan youth.

“If pilots can have a job flying in the region they’re from, not only will they know the area, the weather, but they’re going to be invested in their community and the people that are riding in their airplane,” Klaes says. “For me, creating rural pilots doesn’t just create jobs, it creates more of a safety network for the aviation community.”
