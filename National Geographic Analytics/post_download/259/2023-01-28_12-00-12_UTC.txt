In the winter months, residents view manatees from footbridges and recognize them by the scars they bear from boat propellers. Of adult manatees, 95% have been hit by a boat once, and 25% have been hit at least 10 times. Propeller scars become unique markings and are the easiest way to identify these marine mammals. A collection scientists started in the late 1970s, the Manatee Individual Photo-Identification System database, now provides an extensive portrait of more than 3,800 manatees.
