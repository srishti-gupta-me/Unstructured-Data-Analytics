Photo by @enricsala | Whitetip reef sharks gather around Roca Partida, in Mexico's Revillagigedo National Park, about 400 km (250 miles) south of the Baja peninsula. This is the largest fully protected marine area in North America, with 150,000 square km (58,000 square miles)—an area larger than Greece—under strict protection. The national park provides a refuge for whitetip reef sharks and other shark species, such as whale sharks, hammerheads, and Galapagos sharks. National Geographic Pristine Seas conducted an expedition to the Revillagigedo Islands and provided scientific research that contributed to the creation of the park, where sharks are so abundant that they can exert their ecological role at the top of the food chain. Their presence is vital for the health of the entire ecosystem—in contrast to the false perception of them as dangerous creatures. #SharkAwarenessDay
