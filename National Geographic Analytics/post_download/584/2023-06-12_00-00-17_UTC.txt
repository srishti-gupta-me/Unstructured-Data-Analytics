Photo by @rubensalgadoescudero | Workers use solar lamps to collect newly baked bricks in Saipur, India. The power source allows them to work in cooler evening temperatures and relatively safer conditions. Over the last decade, India has made an aggressive push to provide electricity access for its citizens, with over 99% having grid access in 2019. That number, however, is expected to drop sharply once the impact of the pandemic can be studied.
