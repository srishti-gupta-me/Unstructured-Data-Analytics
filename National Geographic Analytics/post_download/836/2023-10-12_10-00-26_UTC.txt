Photo by @katieorlinsky | The headwaters of the Gila River in the Gila Wilderness of southern New Mexico. The Gila is one of the longest still dam-free rivers of the American West. It's also one of the most endangered rivers in the United States, which is why activists and New Mexico’s senators are backing passage of the M.H. Dutch Salmon Greater Gila Wild and Scenic River Act. The bill would give the Gila River “wild and scenic river” designation and protect more than 440 miles of the Gila River watershed.
