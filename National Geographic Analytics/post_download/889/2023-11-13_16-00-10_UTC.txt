Photo by @heidihanskoch | The flashy tail feathers of the Alexandrine parakeet not only help the bird take flight but also aid in balance and courtship. These birds, found in both South and Southeast Asia, are among the largest parakeets.

When the pandemic hit, my husband, Hans, and I we were looking for a project that we could realize in our studio. As luck would have it, it came to us. We got the offer to photograph two private feather collections and those of the National History Museum in Berlin.

For us, feathers are encounters with the irresistibly beautiful in nature. We wanted to present them as a sensual experience, as poetic masterpieces of evolution. The most amazing feathers we were able to photograph were certainly those of the birds of paradise.

For this project we used the method of focus stacking, in which similar photos with different focal planes are blended to achieve a more profound depth of field.

Every day was a feather day. Gradually our engagement with nature and technology developed into a kind of meditation. In the end, it took us more than two years. To see more from this project, head to the link in bio.
