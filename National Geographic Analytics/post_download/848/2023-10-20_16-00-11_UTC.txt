Photo by @beverlyjoubert | The elephant … and the queleas. If there’s a bird capable of visually dwarfing an elephant, the red-billed quelea certainly qualifies. A single bird may be only the size of a sparrow, but queleas do not travel solo. Instead, they converge to form tightly synchronized flocks, sometimes millions-strong, that move over the landscape like swirling clouds. Such abundance can be destructive, and for farmers in many different parts of Africa, the birds pose a significant threat to cultivated crops. But here in Botswana’s famous Okavango Delta, it is the seeds of wild grasses that sustain them, and their aerial ballet makes for a captivating spectacle.
