Photo by @joelsartore | These caracal kittens were just four weeks old when I photographed them @nashvillezoo. For the first 10 days of life, kittens like these are blind and deaf, making them entirely dependent on mom. Mothers will raise their litter without any help from dad, teaching their kittens everything they need to know before they venture out on their own at nine to 10 months old.
