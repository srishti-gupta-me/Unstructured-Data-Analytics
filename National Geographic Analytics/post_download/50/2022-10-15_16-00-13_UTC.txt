Their diets may vary by location but mostly consist of fish and krill. They're capable of diving to depths of up to 175 meters (575 ft), though they usually feed within the first 70 meters (230 ft)—an incredibly impressive feat. Once they enter the ocean, they also face predators such as leopard seals and killer whales. Fortunately, they're efficient swimmers, and they'll swim in groups to reduce their own chances of becoming a meal.
