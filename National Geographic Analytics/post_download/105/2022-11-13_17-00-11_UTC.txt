Photo by @iantehphotography | The trip was a grand adventure: a rickety train ride from Hanoi toward Lao Cai, near the China border, then a drive up into the picturesque paddy fields in Sapa, where I met up with farmers for a final trek into  cardamom plantations grown under the rainforest canopy. It was also a lesson in Vietnam’s recent environmental history: Black cardamom, thao qua, an essential spice in pho and other Vietnamese dishes, was first planted in the Hoang Lien Mountains in the 1990s as a replacement for opium, a banned crop that once helped prop up Indochina’s colonial economy. The area, known as Hoang Lien National Park, is a symbol of postwar Vietnam’s efforts to protect plant biodiversity. Hence this puzzle: How could a forest simultaneously be a haven for conservation and agricultural cash crop?

Over a few days of camping in the forest, we observe farmers harvesting cherry red pods of raw cardamom with machetes beside a stream. In the afternoons, they smoked the refrigerator-size piles under fire till they turned coffee brown, significantly reducing their weight for the hike back. On our return, we stop at this spot revealing a set of lush green peaks before we dip down into thick vegetation for the remainder of our walk home.
