Photo by @mattiasklumofficial | Landmannalaugar, in Iceland’s highlands region, consists of more geological elements than one can count—rivers, shown here; rhyolite mountains; hot springs. The sensation of looking at things and, in a way, losing the sense of scale is such a cool feeling. I can be working from a helicopter and will get into such a state of flow that I become sucked into the pattern hundreds of feet below. Love it! Please check out my flow, @mattiasklumofficial, for more images and films from my projects around the world.
