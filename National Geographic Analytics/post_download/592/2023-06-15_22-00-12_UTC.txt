Those who can't afford to take a minivan or motorbike walk for one to two hours daily to reach the school.

In December, the Taliban banned women (seen here) from attending private and public universities in Afghanistan, sparking despair among young people in the country. The ban further restricted women's educationâ€”girls had been excluded from secondary schools in September 2021, a month after the Taliban returned to power.
