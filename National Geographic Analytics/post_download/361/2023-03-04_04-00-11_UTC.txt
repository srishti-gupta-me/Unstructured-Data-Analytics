Photo by @joelsartore | This adorable critter is a baby American badger photographed at Nebraska's @newildliferehab. In the wild this little one would belong to a litter, born in early spring. Blind at birth and almost completely helpless, baby badgers are nursed by mom until they are two to three months old. Despite their vulnerable state, youngsters may emerge from the den as early as five weeks old, but wonâ€™t fully venture out on their own until the six-month mark.
