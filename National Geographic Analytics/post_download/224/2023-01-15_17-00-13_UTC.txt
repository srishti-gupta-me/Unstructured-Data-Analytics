Photo by Keith Ladzinski @ladzinski | A nomadic Tuareg poses for a portrait under the Sahara sun. He and a fellow traveler stopped by our camp, a dinosaur excavation site in the remote desert, in search of water. The paleontologists were more than happy to share what they had, and the man allowed me to take his picture. The sword he clasped looked as if it had a history of its own.
