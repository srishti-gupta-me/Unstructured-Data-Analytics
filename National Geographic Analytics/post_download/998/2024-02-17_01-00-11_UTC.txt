Photo by @joelsartore | Einstein is a western long-tailed hornbill I photographed at the North Florida Wildlife Center. In the wild, this species is found in the humid forests of West Africa, where it spends most of its time high up in the trees. Named for their large, curved beaks, most hornbills sport a casque, a hollow structure made of keratin. Casques come in a variety of sizes and colors and serve a number of functions such as attracting a mate and resonating sound to help defend territory.
