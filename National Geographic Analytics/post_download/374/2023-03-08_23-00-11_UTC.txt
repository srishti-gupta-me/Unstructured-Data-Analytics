Worldwide, women and girls spend an estimated 200 million hours daily collecting water, according to UNICEF. This one task robs them of their time and potential. They’re not able to develop their own skills because they must spend all of their free time collecting water. On this International Women’s Day, let’s honor all the accomplishments of women and work toward a world where every woman has the chance to realize her full potential.
