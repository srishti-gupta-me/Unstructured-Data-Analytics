Photo by @kirstenluce | At the Santuario de las Luciernagas in Tlaxcala, Mexico, fireflies take over the forest at dusk on a summer evening. The rhythmic bursts of light are visible through a long exposure that tracks the insects' trails as they move in a circular pattern. The fireflies are most active from June to August.
