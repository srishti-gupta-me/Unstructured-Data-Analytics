A couple of years later, we decided that we loved each other and wanted to be together,” says Evelyn Jenkins Whitaker (at right). She and her wife, Sonja Jackson, have been together for 18 years. Their families, they say, have “embraced us.” 

For six years, in 14 countries, I recorded stories from LGBTQ folks for my project Where Love Is Illegal. Sadly, not all families are as accepting as Evelyn and Sonja’s. Many people told me it was their relatives whose discrimination was the most intense and most damaging. With each Valentine’s Day, it is my hope that we move closer toward recognizing that love is love—nothing else should matter. You can see Evelyn and Sonja’s story, and many others, at @whereloveisillegal. #ValentinesDay
