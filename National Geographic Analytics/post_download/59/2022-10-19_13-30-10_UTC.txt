They remained motionless for nearly half an hour watching the impala herd, waiting for them to move close enough to spring their ambush. While cheetahs might be the fastest land animal, impala are not far behind. They're extremely fast and agile and very difficult to catch. In this case, the cheetahs selected an adult female with a broken leg. She didn't stand a chance and was overpowered by the family of five within seconds.
