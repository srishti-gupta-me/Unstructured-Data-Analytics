Photo by @joelsartore | I am thrilled to introduce the 15,000th species to join the Photo Ark: the Miami tiger beetle. With its stunning, iridescent body, this tiny critter is as mighty as it is striking. The health of this species—a bioindicator—and its population can communicate vital information to researchers about the health of the pine rocklands ecosystem it belongs to, which is under threat from development pressure in southern Florida. 
Learn more about the Miami tiger beetle at the link in bio. To see more species featured in the Photo Ark, follow me, @joelsartore. #PhotoArk
