Most followers know me for my images of the night sky, but this post is my tribute to millions of women in Iran who fight for freedom. Mahsa Amini, 22, was visiting family in Tehran in mid-September when she was arrested for an "improper hijab" (head covering) while riding inside her brother's car. She died several days later, sparking national protests. Amini had suffered multiple blows to the head, according to London-based broadcaster Iran International. 

I was born in Iran in 1978 and lived there for 33 years. During that time, I witnessed women living in daily fear of the hijab police. What is less known to the outside world is that Iranian society appears to be becoming more secular, though strict hijab enforcement is still a focus of the country's leaders. Meanwhile protests continue across the country despite severe crackdowns.
