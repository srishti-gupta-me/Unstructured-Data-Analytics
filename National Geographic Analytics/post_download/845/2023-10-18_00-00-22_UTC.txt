Photo by @katieorlinsky | A view through the foliage of volcanic rock-lined canyons along Whitewater Creek at the northwest boundary of the Gila Wilderness, in southern New Mexico. The wilderness encompasses more than 870 square miles of rough country, including deserts, grasslands, pi√±on and pine forests, 10,000-foot mountains, and walls of slot canyons (seen here) created by one of the longest undammed rivers in the American West: the Gila.
