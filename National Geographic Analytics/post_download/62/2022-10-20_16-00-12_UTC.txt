Photo by @javier_aznar_photography | Saguaro cacti (Carnegiea gigantea), seen here in Arizona, thrive in an extreme habitat. While full of life, it's also one with very high temperatures, flash floods, and cacti spines everywhere, requiring some sidestepping on the part of visitors. Follow me @javier_aznar_photography for more images from the desert. #desert #sunser #arizona #saguaro
