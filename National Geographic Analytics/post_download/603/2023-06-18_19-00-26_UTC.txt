Photo by @ronan_donovan | The silverback mountain gorilla is the protector of his family. While the gorillas can weigh 400 pounds (175 kg), they can also be some of the most gentle apes with their youngâ€”often playing or snuggling with babies and keeping an eye out for them. This silverback from "Pablo's family" group, in Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park, is acting as a warm backrest during a foggy day for a young gorilla. #FathersDay
