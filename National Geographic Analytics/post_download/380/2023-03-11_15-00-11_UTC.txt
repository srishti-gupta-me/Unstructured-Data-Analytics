Photo by @javier_aznar_photography | Escaping horseflies, a male South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris) known as Gonzalito crosses the Tiputini River in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Hunters captured Gonzalito as a baby, and Ecuadorâ€™s Ministry of Environment rescued and released him when he was an adult. Over three years, I was able to observe him in the wild during my visits to the community of Mandari in the Amazon. Unfortunately, Gonzalito died last year, killed during the pandemic under unknown circumstances. Follow @javier_aznar_photography for more stories from the jungle. #tapir #amazon #rainforest
