The park has been a tourist attraction since the early 1900s, when trains stopped to let passengers off to walk the short trail to the spring. Homosassa Springs has four rehabilitating manatees: Two are permanent because they were rescued as juveniles and never acquired the life skills they needed to survive in the wild.
