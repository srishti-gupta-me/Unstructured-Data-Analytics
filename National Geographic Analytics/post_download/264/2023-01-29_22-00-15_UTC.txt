A facade of eucalyptus wood creates shade. Above each classroom, a vent allows hot air to escape. It's a prime example of how traditional building materials and cooling techniques are being reclaimed by contemporary architects as the climate warms. Teachers say the cooler conditions inside the classrooms thwart fighting among students and improve concentration. For the full story, see the link in bio.
