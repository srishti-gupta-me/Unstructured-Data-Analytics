Photo by @beverlyjoubert |There’s plenty of perching room at this oxpecker gathering, in Kenya’s Chyulu Hills. An avian entourage of this size can become a nuisance, but giraffes get benefits in exchange for their tolerance. The birds offer a grooming service that helps to keep ticks and other pesky parasites under control. They’ve also been observed using their sharp beaks for some dental cleaning, picking out bits of food from the giraffes' teeth. Everywhere you look in the natural world, there are fascinating examples of adaptation and interdependence. To see more of my work, follow me @beverlyjoubert.
