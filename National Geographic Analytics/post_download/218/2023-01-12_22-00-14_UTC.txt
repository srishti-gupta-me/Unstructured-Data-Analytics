Photo by @rubensalgadoescudero | Adbul Rahim, 25, holds his sick two-year-old son at a makeshift camp located in a no-man’s-land on the border between Myanmar and Bangladesh. Abdul and his wife walked for 14 days, fleeing the atrocities brought upon his and other Rohingya villages in their home country of Myanmar. Abdul lost his father and all of his belongings when his village was burned to the ground. 

Following an August 2017 attack by Muslim insurgents, Myanmar’s military began carrying out violent operations against the Rohingya in western Rakhine State, which resulted in grave crimes under international law, the torching of whole villages, and more than 700,000 of the Muslim ethnic minority group fleeing into Bangladesh. Despite condemnation from the international community, no real action has been done to secure justice and protection for the Rohingya.
