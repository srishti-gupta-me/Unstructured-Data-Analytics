Photo by @enricsala | Cocos Island National Park in Costa Rica is a shark haven. Hammerheads (seen here in 2009) aggregate by the thousandsâ€”divers can observe schools of 100 to 200 sharks. The park was vastly expanded by the Costa Rican government in 2021, providing a refuge not only for the shallow habitats around the island but also to seamount chains used in their annual migrations. Cocos and a few other protected islands in the eastern tropical Pacific function as stepping stones in the migration of sharks (and other endangered species). But their numbers have been declining steadily: outside of the few areas that are fully protected from fishing, sharks are being slaughtered. Industrial fishing targets sharks directly for the Asian shark fin market and indirectly as bycatch in tuna fisheries. And even small-scale fishers target juvenile hammerhead sharks, which are born in coastal mangroves. The future of sharks depends solely on us.
