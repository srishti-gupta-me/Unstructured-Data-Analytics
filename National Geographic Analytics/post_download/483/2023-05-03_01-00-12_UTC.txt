Photo by @yagazieemezi | When Foyeke Omage of Nigeria was told she was carrying four—and then five—babies, she was in disbelief and called her husband, who screamed in equal disbelief at the news. After six years of trying to conceive, it felt like a miracle. 

In her seventh month of pregnancy, Foyeke was ordered to bed rest in a hospital in Lagos, until she gave birth in January 2021 with the help of seven medical personnel. The Omages' bundles of joy had arrived, three girls and two boys—Mary, Angela, Priscilia, Moses, and Miracle. 
With the children came new worries. "I don't want to call it hell," the parents said wearily, addressing their large debt to the hospital, being behind on rent, and the endless costs of diapers, food, wipes, and day care. They have made several appeals to the government for assistance but have received none. 

Despite all the new difficulties, when asked about their children, they broke out into smiles. "Even as they are now in the day care, we feel them. They are our source of joy." The parents dream big for their children, hoping they receive a good education and that they grow up "to be a blessing to their country."
