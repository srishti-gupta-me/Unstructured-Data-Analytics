Photo by @acacia.johnson | Would you guess that this photo was taken in Antarctica? This historic hut, built by the Swedish South Polar Expedition led by Otto Nordenskjöld in 1902, stands on the shore of Snow Hill Island in Antarctica's Weddell Sea. Here, six members of the expedition spent 22 months studying the region's geology, geography, meteorology, and more. 

For those who sailed through ice-filled seas to reach this remote spot, spotting emperor penguins along the way, it was surreal to discover this desertlike landscape free of snow. What's more, the soft shale of the island preserves fossils of ancient marine animals between 65 million and 145 million years old—a reminder of Antarctica's deep geological history.
