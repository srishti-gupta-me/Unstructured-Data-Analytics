Photo by @joelsartore | Juvenile brown-throated sloths hug each other during a photo shoot @toucanrescueranch, a wildlife rescue center that raises and then releases dozens of baby sloths each year back into the forests of Costa Rica. Even if they arenâ€™t related, orphaned baby sloths like these two are kept together in pairs to comfort each other after losing their mothers.
