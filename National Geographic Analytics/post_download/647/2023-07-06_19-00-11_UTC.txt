Photo by @paoloverzone | The Hoba meteorite outside of Grootfontein, Namibia, named after the farm where it was found, is the largest known in the world. Estimated to weigh more than 67 tons, it remains where it landed less than 80,000 years ago, according to radioactive dating. The meteorite is now surrounded by a tiered viewing area. The story of how early cultures used metal from meteorites appears in the June 2023 magazine and is available to read in the link in bio. Follow @paoloverzone for more images and stories.
