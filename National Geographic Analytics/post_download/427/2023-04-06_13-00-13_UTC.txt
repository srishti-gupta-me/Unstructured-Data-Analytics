Photo by @beverlyjoubert | The swirling mists and golden glow of an Okavango Delta sunrise never fail to evoke awe and quiet wonder. And that’s a feeling worth cultivating. When we marvel at nature—whether the deep wilderness of Botswana or a green corner somewhere less remote—we are reminded of our connection to all other living things, and we learn to care about them in a more profound way. It is through a sense of wonder that we are inspired to protect and preserve the natural world for the generations that will come after us. To see more of my work, follow me @beverlyjoubert.
