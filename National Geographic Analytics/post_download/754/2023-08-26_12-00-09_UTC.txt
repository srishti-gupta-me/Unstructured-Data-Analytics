Photo by @robertclarkphoto | For a story on the evolution of dog breeds, editor Kurt Mutchler and I decided to set up a photo studio at the Hotel Pennsylvania, across from New York's Madison Square Garden—site of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. The hotel has been used as the "bedroom" for the show for decades. 

I approached the portrait sessions with the dogs just as I would with people. A little tilt of the head, a small gesture, or a look in the eye are what makes a picture interesting to me. I was struck by the face and body language of Denzil, a Douge de Bordeaux aka French mastiff, a breed that originated as a war dog and later guarded French hunting estates. Though no longer used as guard dogs, they remain protective of their families and are often seen looking out the window on alert. The dog is now recognized for its face and accompanying slobber—remember the movie Turner & Hooch?
