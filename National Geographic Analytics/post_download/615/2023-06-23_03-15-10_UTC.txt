Photo by @stevewinterphoto | Finding tigers can be a test of patience, but the reward of being in the presence of this mystical creature makes all the hours of driving and waiting disappear—and being one with nature is all that remains. As we drove around India's Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, we listened for the telltale alarm calls from the deer or monkeys. Then the silence was broken. With a piercing call from a sambar—two of them fly over us and into the forest—we see a tiger walking in the distance and settling into a blanket of bamboo leaves.
