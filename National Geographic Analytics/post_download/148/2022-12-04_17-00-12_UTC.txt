Photo by @lucalocatelliphoto | Off the coast of Italy, near the village of Noli, researchers are testing a new kind of agriculture—underwater greenhouses. They hope it could be a solution for arid coastal countries, which must invest in a costly process of desalinating water for crops. These plastic domes—called Nemo's Garden—shelter biospheres containing plant seeds, fans, hydroponic equipment, and a bit of starter water—condensation takes care of the rest. 

Each of the five biospheres is an independent environment. Light is provided by the penetrating sun, but when needed a ring (center) gives an extra boost. A small fan keeps air circulating. The garden is monitored remotely by a crew on shore.

This story is part of a long-term project on circular solutions, created with the support of the Museum of Photography Gallerie d'Italia Torino @gallerieditalia in partnership with the Ellen McArthur Foundation.
