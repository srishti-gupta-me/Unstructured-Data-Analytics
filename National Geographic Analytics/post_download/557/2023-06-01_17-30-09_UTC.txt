Photo by @kiliiiyuyan | I’m on assignment in Greenland, where narwhals come to feed and give birth to calves deep into fjords when the sea ice retreats. The light was golden at around midnight during the 24-hour daylight of polar summer. Narwhals have been hunted by the Inughuit here for millennia, and today hunters continue to use the same traditions  alongside a newer quota management system designed to ensure the narwhal population remains healthy. The region’s wildlife is prolific due to both excellent traditional management and an area of high current known as the North Water Polynya. The polynya remains ice free even in winter and creates an incredible habitat for narwhals, walruses, as well as the polar bears and people that depend on them.
