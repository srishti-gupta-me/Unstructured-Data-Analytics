Photo by @beverlyjoubert | There are so many extraordinary things we can learn from observing elephants, like these here photographed in Kenya’s Amboseli National Park. Lessons about the depth of social bonds, about the value of generational wisdom and memory, about the poignant role of mourning and the joy of familial togetherness. Studying these iconic giants also allows us to tap into knowledge that may one day help our own species. Scientists researching elephants’ complex genetic secrets, for example, are beginning to unravel how these animals can evade diseases such as cancer—and hoping to apply the findings in service of humans. Wherever you look, there are countless reasons to protect and preserve nature’s bounty … for our own good. #elephants #wildlife #elephantherd
