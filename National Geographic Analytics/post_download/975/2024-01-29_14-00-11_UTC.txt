Photo by @dina_litovsky | A young woman takes off her high-heeled shoes at the end of a debutante ball in New York City. These balls are a curious coming-of-age ritual for New York and international high society, a vestige of a bygone era. The debutantes, women between 18 and 25, have to apply and are chosen based on their education, accomplishments, and background. My work explores such rituals and rites of passage of different layers of society. To see more, follow me @dina_litovsky.
