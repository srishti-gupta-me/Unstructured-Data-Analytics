Photo by @rubensalgadoescudero | A Maasai man walks along a railroad track after a day herding his livestock in Kenya’s Masai Mara. The Maasai people are an Indigenous ethnic group in southern Kenya and northern Tanzania who maintain their way of life, despite government programs encouraging them to give up their seminomadic lifestyle. The Maasai’s traditional survival skills—such as the ability to produce food in dry, arid lands—offer strategies for adapting to environments altered by climate change, an Oxford study has found.
