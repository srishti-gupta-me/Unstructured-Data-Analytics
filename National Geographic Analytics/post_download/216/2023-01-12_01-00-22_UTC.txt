Photo by Matthieu Paley @paleyphoto | I have always been fascinated by what happens to your brain when you go for very long walks. Many of my favorite photo stories have involved walking, often for weeks on end, carrying everything I needed on my back. Here, after a long day’s walk in extreme heat, a pilgrim named Reyaz Husein emerges after taking a dip in a water hole on a pilgrimage route in Pakistan’s Baluchistan Province. Reyaz has done the 180-kilometer-long (112-mile) walk more times than he can recall. For two weeks, I and a few hundred men and women walked under a blistering heat, sleeping at night under the stars and following ancient pilgrimage trails that link holy shrines.
