Photo by Prasenjeet Yadav @prasen.yadav | These fascinating living root bridges, known locally as jingkieng jri, are found in the foothills of the Himalaya, in India's Meghalaya state. The bridges are a force of nature and human ingenuity, and I was humbled to learn about the intertwined root structures from people whose ancestors crafted them about 200 years ago. For a magazine story, we wanted to show them in a new way. After brainstorming with fellow photographer and lighting inspiration  @anandavarma, we decided to make nighttime portraits, using artificial lighting to isolate the big green bridges from their never-ending rainforest background. With the massive size of these Ficus elastica trees, the project was tricky. But after weeks of trying, the resulting images were close to what we had in mind: to make them look like they're right out of Lord of the Rings. Follow me @prasen.yadav for more photos from India.
