Photo by Aaron Huey @argonautphoto | The alpha female of the Iron Creek wolf pack breaks a trail through fresh snow, followed by her male partner and their kin in Alaska's Denali National Park. Today is International Wolf Day, a moment to remind ourselves how these apex predators shape ecosystems, regulate prey populations, and help uphold the intricate balance and the wild spirit of places like Denali. Their presence supports many other wildlife, from the scavengers feasting on the remains of their hunts to the plants flourishing due to balanced herbivore numbers. I watched this pack over the course of three days as they devoured a moose, and then I was lucky enough to catch them as they left that site, crossing this large, unbroken field. In other parts of the park with less snow, it was harder to see the wolves in the patchy brown and green of the trees. This shot was the result of a little luck, but mostly relentless searching for the right pack in the right photo conditions. The payoff was worth the time put in!
