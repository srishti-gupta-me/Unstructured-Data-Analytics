Composite image of 15 sequential photos by Reuben Wu @reuben | The SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket leaves Earth's orbit on February 6, 2018. During a late-night photo shoot for a series in the wilderness of northern Arizona, I noticed a fast-moving point of light in the sky behind this rock formation. Without knowing what it was (and slightly concerned), I kept pressing the shutter button until it expanded into a glowing white cloud. It was at that moment I realized I was witnessing a rocket launch.

Later I received confirmation that it was indeed the first demonstration flight of the Falcon Heavy that launched from Florida but left Earth's orbit somewhere over Arizonaâ€”a very serendipitous photobomb. For more photos, follow me @reuben #WorldSpaceWeek
