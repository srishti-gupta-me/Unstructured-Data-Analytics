Photo by @brianskerry | An orca in the Norwegian Arctic feeds on a herring that's fallen from the net of a commercial fishing vessel. I first documented orca in this location in 1994. I was aware of their wild, cooperative feeding strategy, but in recent years this opportunistic feeding seems to be more common.  Maybe orca have learned that "takeout" food is easier than making dinner for yourself! For more on the culture of whales, go to the link in bio. #Orca #Whales
