Photo by Orsolya Haarberg @fjellheimengalleri | At Iceland's Hraunfossar waterfalls, innumerable underground creeks reach the surface from below the Hallmundarhraun lava field and tumble into the Hvítá River. The falls are about a kilometer (0.6 miles) in length. A bog bilberry in all its autumn splendor carpets the foreground. Please follow @fjellheimengalleri for more images, primarily from the Nordic countries. #hraunfossar #iceland #landscapephotography #autumn #Hallmundarhraun
