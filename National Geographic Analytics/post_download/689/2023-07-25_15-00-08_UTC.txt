Photo by Orsolya Haarberg @fjellheimengalleri | The spiked top of Nautgardstinden in Norway's Jotunheimen National Park emerges from retreating clouds. Fresh snow covers the landscape after the previous night's storm. This image is part of my exhibition, “Inspired by Nordic Nature,” on view in Vågå, Norway, this summer. Please follow @fjellheimengalleri for more images from Scandinavia.
