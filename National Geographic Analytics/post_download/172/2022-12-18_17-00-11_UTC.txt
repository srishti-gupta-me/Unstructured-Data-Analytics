Photo by @joelsartore | Sand cats like Sven, as he's called, are master hunters. These felines skulk close to the ground, listening for prey burrowing underground. At the first hint of a potential meal, the sand cat will begin digging rapidly to expose and capture prey. While they feed primarily on small rodents, this species can also successfully capture hares, birds, spiders, and even venomous snakes. Photo taken @chattanoogazoo.
