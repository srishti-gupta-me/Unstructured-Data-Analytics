Photo by @rubensalgadoescudero | Butcher Mugerwa Lawrence, 50, works in his small shop until 1 a.m. in Kalagala, Uganda, where just 38% of the population has access to grid electricity. Solar power allows him to work longer hours and during the evening, when the temperature is more comfortable and he can see more clients. This image is part of my Solar Portraits project, which focuses on electricity access and the impact of solar power in communities around the world. Follow me on @rubensalgadoescudero to see the world through my lens. #solar #Uganda #solarportraits #solarpanels #solarpower #butcher
