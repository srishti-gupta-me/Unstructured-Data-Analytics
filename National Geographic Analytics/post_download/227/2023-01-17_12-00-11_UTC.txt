Photo by Brendan Hoffman @hoffmanbrendan | A boy plays the accordion for passersby in Kyiv, Ukraine, in late October. After making a few frames, I interrupted him just long enough to ask his name. Damian, he told me. I dropped some coins into his case and moved on, not wanting to disturb his efforts. The response to this image when it was first published, in early November, was overwhelming. I went back to this spot a number of times since. I wanted to learn more about him and let him know that his picture had touched the hearts of people all over the world, but I havenâ€™t seen Damian again.
