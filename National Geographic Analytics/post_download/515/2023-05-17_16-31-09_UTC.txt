Photo by Robin Hammond @hammond_robin | Today is International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia. This couple allowed me to photograph them for my project @whereloveisillegal. 

They told me what it’s like to be gay in Ghana: “We met three years ago. We thought love never existed in our world. Little did we know love is everywhere, but the challenge is bitter." They hide their relationship to avoid being judged or attacked. Both men feel rejected by their communities and have been the victims of homophobic violence. 

They are not alone in facing discrimination. At least 62 countries have laws criminalizing same-sex relations between consenting adults. In addition, at least nine countries have laws criminalizing forms of gender expression that target transgender and gender-nonconforming people. “We’re living in a world of fear,” says one of the men (seated).
