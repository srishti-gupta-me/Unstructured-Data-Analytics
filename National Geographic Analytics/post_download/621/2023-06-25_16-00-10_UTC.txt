Photo by @jasperdoest | At the Balaju Bridge in Kathmandu, 52-year-old Rupak Darshan visits daily to feed the crows and stray dogs. Having faced a life of hardship, including job loss and sexual abuse incidents that left him HIV-positive, Darshan finds solace and comfort in this place. “I understand the plight of the dogs as only a person who has faced such difficulties can truly know how it feels,” he says. Amid the chaos of Nepal’s capital city, Darshan and the dogs find peace together: “These dogs are my only family.” Follow me @jasperdoest for more on the relationship between humankind and nature
