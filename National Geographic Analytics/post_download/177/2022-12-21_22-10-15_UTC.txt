Photo by @beverlyjoubert | Mastering an appendage as tricky as the elephant trunk comes with a steep learning curve, and this young calf on the plains of the Masai Mara in Kenya still has a way to go. Elephants are known for their expressive nature, and that’s in no small part due to their dexterous trunks and flapping ears. New research shows that up to 63,000 neurons are at work in the part of the elephant brain that controls facial movement—that’s compared to just 8,000–9,000 in humans. It’s little wonder then that the elephant trunk one of nature’s most extraordinary tools. #elephants #elephantcalf #wildlife #elephantsofinstagram
