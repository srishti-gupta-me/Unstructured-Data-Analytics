Photo by @mattiasklumofficial | Meerkats are great at working together in numbers. A few will typically serve as lookouts, watching the skies for birds of prey such as hawks and eagles that can snatch them up from the ground ... along with photographers setting up behind their backs.

A sharp, shrill call is the signal for all to take cover in burrows or holes. While a few individuals guard the group, the rest forage for the foods that make up their varied diet: insects, lizards, eggs, birds, and fruit. Meerkats are very efficient and entrepreneurial huntersâ€”and delightfully entertaining to study in the field. Shot on assignment for @natgeo in the Kalahari, South Africa.
