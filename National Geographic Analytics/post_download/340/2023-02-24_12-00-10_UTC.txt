Photo by @brianskerry | A curious gray seal swims right up to my camera in the waters of the Gulf of Maine. Gray seal populations throughout New England were decimated after centuries of hunting, but their numbers have rebounded substantially since the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act was passed in 1972. This image is from my upcoming story in @natgeo.
