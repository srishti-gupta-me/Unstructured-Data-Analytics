The new National Geographic documentary film "Return of the White Shark," produced by me, alongside Adam Geiger and Colette Beaudry (@sealightpictures), debuts this weekend. It focuses on the great white sharks around Cape Cod, Massachusetts, which in recent years has become a hub of white shark activity. The film explores shark behavior and the cutting-edge research being conducted to better understand these animals and increase public safety.

"Return of the White Shark" premieres as part of Sharkfest on @disneyplus and @hulu on July 2 and National Geographic Channel (@natgeotv) on July 3 at 9 p.m. ET
