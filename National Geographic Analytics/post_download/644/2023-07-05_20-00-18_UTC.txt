Photo by @amivitale | Two panda cubs wrestle and frolic. These adorable creatures are a testament to what can happen when we work together and value nature and our environment. 

For years the breeding secrets of pandas baffled scientists. When China first established a panda breeding program, it was not successful. Pandas were thought to be a species without a sex drive. 

Scientists have finally cracked the puzzle of captive breeding and have started reintroducing pandas to the wild. The trick? To create in captivity the conditions that appeal to the particulars of this picky animal. Scent, it turns out, is critically important to pandas, as is male competition. Males will carefully scent different parts of their body and nearby enclosures to broadcast their odor. Female pandas are in estrus just once a year, for 24 to 72 hours, so timing is critical.

The journey covering the rewilding of these endearing animals for National Geographic turned out to be one of the most unimaginable explorations I've ever had. Learn more by following @amivitale. @vital.impacts
