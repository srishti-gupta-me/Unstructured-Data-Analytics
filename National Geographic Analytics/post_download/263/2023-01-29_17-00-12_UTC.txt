Photo by @acacia.johnson | A cabin faces Safety Sound, Alaska. This protected lagoon near Nome has been a critical hunting, fishing, and gathering ground for Alaska Native peoples for millenniaâ€”favored for its protected waters and rich migratory bird life. Today it's globally recognized as an Important Bird Area, key to conservation efforts. Follow me at @acacia.johnson for more stories from Alaska and beyond. #alaska #safetysound #nome
