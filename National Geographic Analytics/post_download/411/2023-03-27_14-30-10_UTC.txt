Photo by Orsolya Haarberg @fjellheimengalleri | On a calm winter night, steam rises from the volcanic vents of Icelandâ€™s Hverir. The steam responded to the slightest air movements. The columns of hot water vapor danced to the melody of a breeze so gentle I could barely feel it on my skin. The northern lights appeared in the sky, moving much faster than the rising vapor. It was tight, but I managed to capture them both in the same frame while keeping the shutter open for 10 seconds.
