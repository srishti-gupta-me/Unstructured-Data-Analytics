Photo by @estherhorvath | How do people on polar expeditions spend their free time and evenings far away from civilization, where there is no mobile phone connection, no TV, no internet, and no radio? On expeditions you have to solve everything yourself, and that was also the case for MOSAiC, in the central Arctic Ocean. One evening, boatswain Sebastian Br√ºck opened a pop-up barbershop in the metal workstation of our ship, Polarstern, to get a much needed haircut. Here, Captain Stefan Schwarze gets his turn after two months on board. Please follow @estherhorvath and @awiexpedition for further polar stories.
