Photo by Matthieu Paley @paleyphoto | Near the eastern end of the Wakhan corridor, a panhandle region of Afghanistan, roads dwindle to footpaths, where a girl twists the tail of the family cow to hurry it toward their home. I was following along with Paul Salopek as he headed into the distant Pamir Mountains on his unique storytelling odyssey across the Earth. His 21,000-mile (34,000 km) walk following the path of human migration out of Africa began in 2013. For more on the Out of Eden project, go to @outofedenwalk and the link in bio.
