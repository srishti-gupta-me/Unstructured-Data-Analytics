Photo by @joelsartore | Native to Madagascar, tomato frogs belong to a variety of habitats across the northeastern part of the island. They've been found to adapt well to urban environments and are spotted in drainage ditches and on farmland as often as they're seen within rainforests. Their only “must-haves” include places to burrow and slow-moving or stagnant water where they can lay their eggs. Photo taken @theomahazoo.
