Photo by @williamodaniels | Twenty-year-old Natalia of the Evenk Indigenous group sits aboard the Matvei Mudrov medical train in Russia. Roughly twice a year, the mobile clinic travels the country’s Baikal–Amur Magistral railway line, which crosses Siberia to the Russian Far East for more than 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles), and stops at villages along the way to provide medical care to residents. Named after Matvei Yakovlevich Mudrov, a 19th-century physician who helped establish clinical practice in Russia, the train is operated by the state-owned Russian Railways and employs around 15 doctors who offer specialized services, including x-ray, ultrasound, neurology, and ophthalmology. For many communities along the rail line, the Matvei Mudrov represents a rare connection to the rest of the country.
