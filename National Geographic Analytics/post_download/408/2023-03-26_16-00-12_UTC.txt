Photo by @rubensalgadoescudero | Daw Mu Nan, 45, a farmer and mother of eight, rests at her grandson's home in the village of Pa Dan Kho, located in eastern Myanmar's Kayah State. The Kayan Lahwi tribe are a subgroup of the Karenni people, the Tibeto-Burman ethnic minority of Myanmar. The women are known for wearing neck rings, brass coils that are placed around the neck, appearing to lengthen it.

Thanks to solar power, Daw Mu Nan can visit with her grandchildren in the evenings after a day of working on the field. 

This is part of my ongoing project Solar Portraits, which focuses on the lack of electricity around the world and the impact of solar power on different communities. Follow me on @rubensalgadoescudero to see the world through my lens. #solarportraits #solar #Myanmar #solarpanels #solarpower
