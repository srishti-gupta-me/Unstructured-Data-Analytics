Photo by @jenguyton | It was truly awe-inspiring to spend 10 hours with this pride of lions while on assignment in Lemek Conservancy, Kenya, as they polished off a wildebeest they'd ambushed at a watering hole. Here, the male lion prevents the lionesses from eating. Although the lionesses are often the ones that make the kill, male lions are much bigger and stronger and will use aggression to ensure that they eat first. This photo was made using infrared lights and modified cameras to minimize disturbing the lions' nocturnal behaviors.
