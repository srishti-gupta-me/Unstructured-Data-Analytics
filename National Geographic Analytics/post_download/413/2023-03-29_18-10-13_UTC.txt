Photo by @beverlyjoubert | With fewer than 6,000 painted dogs surviving in the African wild today, every litter of pups is precious. The Okavango Delta and surrounding areas of northern Botswana are home to one of the worldâ€™s largest remaining populations, making them a rare haven for these highly endangered carnivores. Challenges like climate change are now compounding long-standing threats such as human-wildlife conflict and habitat loss, and the future of the species looks increasingly uncertain. Luckily, in the highly social and cooperative society of painted dogs, pup rearing is a responsibility to be shared among members of the pack, meaning these youngsters will have a strong support system to give them the best chances of survival.
