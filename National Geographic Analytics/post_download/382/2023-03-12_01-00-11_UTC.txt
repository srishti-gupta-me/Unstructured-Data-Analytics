Photo by @michaelchristopherbrown | Trekkers head back from a waterfall-soaked adventure inside Kahuzi-Biega National Park, located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Named for its two extinct volcanoes, the park is home to a population of 250 protected eastern lowland gorillasâ€”believed to be the last remaining. Gorilla trekking is the prime draw at the park; the area also hosts a chimpanzee habituation program at Lwiro Sanctuary as well as bird watching activities. The park is home to over 349 species, with 42 endemic to the region. Follow me at @michaelchristopherbrown for more stories from around the world.
