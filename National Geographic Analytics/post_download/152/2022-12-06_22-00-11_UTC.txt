Photo by @davidemonteleonestudio | The Pamir mountain landscape on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border, 2016. Tajikistan has been at the crossroads of civilizations for over a thousand yearsâ€”and occupied by Russians, Turks, Arabs, Uzbeks, Chinese, and Genghis Khan and the Mongols. In more recent years, the country served as a key staging area and supply route for U.S. and NATO operations against the Taliban. Like other Central Asian nations, Tajikistan has been heavily dependent on Russia for economic aid, security assistance, and labor markets. Follow me @davidemonteleonestudio for more.
