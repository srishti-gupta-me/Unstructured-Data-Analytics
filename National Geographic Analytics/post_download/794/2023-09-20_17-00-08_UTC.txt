Photo by @joelsartore | Meet Spock, a Hanuman langur at the Zagreb, Croatia, zoo. Its common name derives from the Hindu god Lord Hanuman, and the species indeed is considered sacred by many Hindus. Because they are held in high regard, these langurs are usually left undisturbed in their home ranges. However, that habitat is diminishing due to activities like slash-and-burn agriculture, grazing, and open-pit mining, forcing these primates into more direct competition for resourcesâ€”which could ultimately lead to conflict and the persecution of the species.
