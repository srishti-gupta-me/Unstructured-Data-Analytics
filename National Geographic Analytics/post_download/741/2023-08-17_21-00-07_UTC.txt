Some of the most important—and most endangered—tidal flats are found surrounding the Yellow Sea along the shores of China and the western side of the Korean peninsula. For decades, people have transformed them into industrial sites and farms, squeezing them into smaller areas and pushing some species to the brink of extinction. But as science increasingly shows how wetlands like these benefit wildlife and help fight climate change, South Korean scientists and conservationists are gaining momentum in their effort to save and restore what’s left—becoming a blueprint for tidal flat conservation and ecotourism.
