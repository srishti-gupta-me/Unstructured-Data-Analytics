Photo by @brentstirton | Happy World Pangolin Day! A patient caregiver at a secret site in Zimbabwe cares for a rescued pangolin, helping the traumatized animal find ants and termites to eat and keeping him safe from predators and traffickers. Pangolins are the worldâ€™s most trafficked nonhuman mammals, highly prized in Asia for their meat as a delicacy and their scales as part of traditional medicine. The Tikki Hywood Foundation undertakes public awareness campaigns about pangolins, trains law enforcement and judiciary personnel, conducts research, and rehabilitates animals that have been confiscated from the illegal trade. Based in Zimbabwe, it operates with partners across Africa. The trust also engages with other organizations and governments throughout Africa to highlight the plight of pangolins, raising awareness of their conservation status and helping people learn about caring for rescued pangolins. #WorldPangolinDay
