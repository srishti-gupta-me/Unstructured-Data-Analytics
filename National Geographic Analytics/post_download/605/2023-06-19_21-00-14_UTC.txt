Photo by @paoloverzone | At the turn of the 19th century, scientists in Europe still debated the existence of meteorites. Then, in 1803, one exploded in the sky and rained about 3,000 stones on L’Aigle, France. Some of the stones are displayed at the Natural History Museum Vienna, along with a report from a scientist who investigated and declared the event “the most astonishing phenomenon ever observed by man.” Read more about the discovery and early use of meteorites in the June 2023 magazine or at the link in bio.
