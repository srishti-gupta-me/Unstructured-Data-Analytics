Photo by @amivitale | One of the first baby orphaned elephants at Reteti Elephant Sanctuary learns how to use his trunk. Because baby elephants do not need to use their trunks while they're still drinking milk from their mother, it takes time and experimentation to get the hang of using it. Much like human babies, who come to discover their hands and feet, young elephants seem to discover their trunks as they get older. Reteti is a community-owned elephant sanctuary in northern Kenya. The elephants are rescued, rehabilitated, and sent back to the wild when they're old enough to survive on their own. This oasis where orphans grow up and learn to be wild is a story as much about the elephants as it is about the remarkable people who have committed themselves to protecting them. @r.e.s.c.u.e #WorldNatureConservationDay
