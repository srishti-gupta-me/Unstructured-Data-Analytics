Photo by @heidihanskoch| | It may seem wildly impractical, but flashy plumage—such as the long, shimmery tail feathers of the king bird of paradise—evolved to serve a key goal: attracting potential mates.

The coronavirus came, and we were looking for a “corona compliant” project that we could realize in our studio. As luck would have it, the project came to us. We got the offer to photograph two private feather collections and those of the National History Museum in Berlin.

For us, feathers are encounters with the irresistibly beautiful in nature. We wanted to present them as a sensuous experience, as poetic masterpieces of evolution. The most amazing feathers we were able to photograph were certainly those of the birds of paradise.

We used the method of focus stacking to get the greatest possible depth of field for this project. Every day was a feather day. Gradually our engagement with nature and technology developed into a kind of meditation. In the end, it took us more than two years.
