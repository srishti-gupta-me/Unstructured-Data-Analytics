Photo by @beverlyjoubert | Kenya is home to one of the largest populations of rhinos in Africa, and photographing these iconic animals always brings a sense of wonder—they stand among some of the last representatives of our planet’s once abundant bestiary of megafauna. With their distinctive front horns that can grow to an average of 90cm (or almost 3ft) in length—and in the case of this individual, astonishingly longer—white rhinos and their relatives epitomize the grandeur and uniqueness of the Earth’s wildlife heritage. As demand for rhino horn continues to decimate Africa's populations, can we protect them so that future generations can also marvel at these majestic creatures in the wild?
