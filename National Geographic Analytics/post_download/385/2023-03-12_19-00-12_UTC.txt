Photo by @babaktafreshi | In 2009, on a peaceful starry night in a remote village in Iran's southeastern Sistan and Baluchestan Province, this group, well past their bedtime, was curious to see what I was doing out here in the darkâ€”I photograph the night sky. I'm also originally from Iran. In the past few months, people in this province lost their lives while standing up for freedom against security forces that used snipers and warfare on unarmed protestors. Human rights agencies estimated that 70 children under the age of 18 have been killed in the nationwide protests that began in the wake of the death of Mahsa Amini. The UN Human Rights Council has launched an investigation into allegations around the deaths as well as the torture of protesters and missing persons.
