Photo by Matthieu Paley @paleyphoto | Like many of my colleagues, I get often asked, “How do you become a National Geographic photographer?” My answer is often that you don’t “want" to be a National Geographic photographer; you just want to be a photographer who pursues a story like your life depends on it. That story must keep you up at night and make your heart beat faster. If you pursue it and work your craft, good things will invariably come. But it takes time—years. It’s not always easy, and aspiring photographers can be too impatient. 

This photograph is from a story I worked on and off for more than 15 years, in Afghanistan’s Wakhan Corridor. It had turned into an obsession, requiring multiple expeditions in every season, learning the language and the landscape, and dealing with stress and joy. The image was taken in 2017 in a high pasture in the Pamir mountains, reachable after a two-week-long expedition. Sidol (at left), Jumagul (center), and Assan Khan were returning on their yaks after monitoring the growth of grasses at lower elevations. Herds would be kept off that pasture so the grasses could be harvested, dried, and used by the Wakhi people for animal fodder in the winter months. I was talking on the satellite phone with my wife on a hill when I saw these beasts climbing up toward me. I had to hang up … and was forgiven!
