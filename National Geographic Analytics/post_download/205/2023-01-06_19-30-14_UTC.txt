Photo by @beverlyjoubert | For the hippopotamus, an animal that spends much of its day submerged, the watery landscape of Botswana’s world-famous Okavango Delta is a true haven. But prime real estate in these channels and waterways needs to be defended, especially when water levels drop and these supersize animals are forced to share territory. Hippos have an infamously short fuse, which means aquatic disagreements can quickly escalate from bravado and territorial yawning to physical—and sometimes fatal—clashes.
