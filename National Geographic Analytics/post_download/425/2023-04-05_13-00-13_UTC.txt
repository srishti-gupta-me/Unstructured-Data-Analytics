Photo by @estherhorvath | When I met Alyse Dietel in Iceland this January, I sensed an inner strength I couldn't quite put my finger on—until I learned of her story and her conviction to achieve the impossible. 

In 2012, Dietel, then a professional climber, fell 80 feet (25 m) from a cliff while on a hike with a friend. She ended up with a shattered pelvis, a broken tailbone, ankle, and ribs, two fractured vertebrae, a partially collapsed lung, kidney damage, a sprained neck, and numerous bruises and lacerations. Doctors told her she might never walk again. Before the fall, she was at the peak of her climbing career and had competed nationally for the U.S. for eight years. 

Her doctor's words were inconceivable. But she believed in herself, and with a will to walk and climb again, she began a healing process that included a mental strength regimen. Her goal was one year to heal. At eight months and one week, she was standing. Three weeks later, she was getting around on crutches. The following month, she went to a climbing gym and completed the easiest route. Soon after, she was back on the cliffs. Today she climbs just for the pure joy of it and now works as an artist, illustrating nature, wildlife, and pets. 

When I met her, she was in Skagaströnd for a month-long residency. One morning we went to see the Icelandic horses before sunrise—which was then at 11:30 a.m.
