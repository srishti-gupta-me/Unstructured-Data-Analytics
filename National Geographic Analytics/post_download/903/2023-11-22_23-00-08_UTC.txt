Known as the Cursed Amethyst, this jewel inspired the plot of Anthony Doerr’s bestselling novel, “All The Light We Cannot See.” But was the sapphire really cursed? That was the claim made by its former owner Edward Heron-Allen. In a letter entrusting the real-life gem to the Natural History Museum in London, the polymath and author called the stone “trebly accursed and stained with blood” and advised its future owners to cast it into the sea. Well, they didn’t—and to this day, the jewel retains a spooky reputation as a stone with the power to curse anyone who touches it. 

But is the “curse” real—or does it simply reveal a society grappling with guilt over its colonial past? Find out at the link in bio.
