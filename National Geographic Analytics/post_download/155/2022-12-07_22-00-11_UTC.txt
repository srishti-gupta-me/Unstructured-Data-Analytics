At the German Environmental Specimen Bank, cryo-storage tanks hold thousands of vials of blood and urine, annually collected from volunteers on behalf of the German Environment Agency. Inside the tanks, liquid nitrogen keeps the samples in a deep freeze. The vials are stored in racks that sit in a cloud of gaseous nitrogen above the liquid. 

It's part of the federal ministry's effort to monitor exposure to chemicals like lead, mercury, and plasticizers. The project traces which substances have accumulated at potentially dangerous levels, and considers whether bans and regulations of some of those substances have been effective.
