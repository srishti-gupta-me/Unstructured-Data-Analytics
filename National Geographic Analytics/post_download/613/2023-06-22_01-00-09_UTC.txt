Photo by @joelsartore | Meet King Max, a king vulture I photographed at the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas. Hatched in 2006, this handsome fellow was hand-reared by a care team, and in 2018 moved to Belize to act as an ambassador for his wild counterparts. Found in Central and South America, these birds face a number of challenges that have led to declines in their population. The zoo participates in the king vulture species survival plan, along with a number of other zoos, to maintain a healthy captive population of the birds, ensuring the species will survive in the event the wild population cannot sustain itself. To see more species featured in the Photo Ark, follow me @joelsartore. #PhotoArk @gladysporterzoo
