Photo by @tamaramerino_photography | This image of Chilean Patagonia was selected as one of National Geographic's 17 best travel photos of the year. With dramatic peaks, verdant forests, and a swath of ice larger than anywhere but Greenland and Antarctica, it offers travelers one of the last wild frontiers. 

About 88% of the country's glaciers can be found in the Northern Patagonian Ice Field. It's one of the world's critical water reserves, and the effects of climate change are visible and dramatic here. The Exploradores Glacier is receding an average of 0.7-0.8 meters (2.2.-2.6 ft) each year. Part of the ice tongue is covered by moraine, an accumulation of debris that comes with glacial movement.
