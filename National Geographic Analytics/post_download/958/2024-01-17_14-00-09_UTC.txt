Photo by @mattiasklumofficial | I photographed this Patagonian fox (also called the South American gray fox) in Torres del Paine National Park, Chile, during a @natgeo assignment. This particular individual was a good model: beautiful, easily habituated, and curious. Torres del Paine is stunning and has become one of my favorite parks in South America.
