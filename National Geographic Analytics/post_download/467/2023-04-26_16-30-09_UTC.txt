One place where they and other LGBTQI+ people encounter some of the greatest discrimination is Uganda. Last month the 2023 Anti-Homosexuality Bill was introduced in the Ugandan parliament. The country’s penal code already punishes homosexual relations with life in prison. This bill would further criminalize people simply for identifying as LGBTQI+. It also includes the death penalty for so-called aggravated homosexuality and life in prison for gay sex. 

Kasha Jacqueline Nabagesera is a leader in the fight for LGBTQI+ rights in Uganda. The new law, if adopted, would mean she could be arrested just for identifying as a lesbian. These laws, and anti-LGBTQI+ rhetoric, also leads to an increase in hate crimes. Kasha knows this all too well. When I was producing my project @whereloveisillegal, Kasha shared her story. “People have threatened me with death many times,” she said. “They want to cut off my head, kill me.” While she continues to live with this fear, she also lives with hope. Speaking about the new proposed law, she says, “It's a big step backwards, but more than ever we shall not give up.”
