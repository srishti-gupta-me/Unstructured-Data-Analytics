Photo by @alessandro.cinque | An alpaca fetus is analyzed under a microscope at the Quimsachata Research and Production Center in the Puno region of southeastern Peru. The center, using a process that includes insemination and embryo transfers, aims to create genetically “improved” alpacas that offer higher fiber quality and are more resilient to disease and the effects of climate change. Indigenous communities often raise money to buy one of these specimens to add to their livestock. Tens of thousands of families depend on alpacas for their livelihoods, but climate change poses a growing risk to the animals and the communities they sustain. The Andes are experiencing shorter but more intense rainy seasons and longer periods of drought. Frosts and hailstorms have become more common. Changing weather patterns are shrinking natural pastures and reducing grass quality, forcing alpaca herds to compete for food.
