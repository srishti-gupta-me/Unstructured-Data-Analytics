Photo by @thomaspeschak | Mozambique's Niassa Special Reserve upends the myth of Africa’s pro­tected areas as Edens untouched by human presence. For thou­sands of years people here have gathered food from the land and coexisted with wildlife. They weren’t displaced when the reserve was created, and some now help maintain this conservation wilderness, with its braided rivers and jutting granite inselbergs. 

I spent three months photographing the relationship between people and wildlife in this remote corner of Africa. Niassa is one of the most fascinating places on the planet. I had the privilege of witnessing a nocturnal honey harvest by firelight in a giant baobab tree and had close encounters with dozens of baboons at a sacred ceremonial site.
