Photo by @brianskerry | A common tern brings a sand lance back to its nest and waiting chick on the Isles of Shoals in the Gulf of Maine. As seawater temperatures here rise because of climate change, slender-bodied fish like sand lances become scarce, and wide-bodied species, like butterfish, which historically have not been abundant here, are caught by the terns instead. Due to their body shape, butterfish are harder to swallow, especially for the chicks, and the young birds can starve. #seabirds #GulfofMaine
