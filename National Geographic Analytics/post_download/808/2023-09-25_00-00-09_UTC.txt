Photo by @acacia.johnson | A Pacific walrus rests on the shore of Round Island in Alaska’s Walrus Islands State Game Sanctuary. The particular sheen of these marine mammals, glowing slightly from the island’s dark and weather-smoothed rocks, remains one of the most otherworldly—and thought-provoking—wildlife encounters of my photography career. 

Walruses are a keystone species, meaning they help shore up the entire biotic community they live in. When they forage on the seafloor, they churn up vast quantities of nutrient-rich sediment, providing food not just for smaller organisms but all the way up to seabirds, larger fish, seals, and even polar bears farther north. But despite their vital role in the ecosystem, they often fall low on the priority list for conservation. Read more about the walruses of Round Island in the link in bio.
