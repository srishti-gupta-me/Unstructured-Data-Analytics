Photo by @sofia_jaramillo5 | Filmmaker and photographer Jr Rodriguez casts during the golden hour in the Teton River near Driggs, Idaho, while filming Wading for Change. The movie was recently selected by the National Geographic Short Film Showcase and premieres on National Geographic's YouTube page August 16. In Texas, where Jr grew up, he started fishing without fancy gear or vast landscapes as his backdrop. His love for the outdoors was solidified during family outings and alongside his Latinx community. The film shows how passion for the outdoors can blossom through community, regardless of economic status, location, or skin color.
