Photo by @beverlyjoubert | It's impossible to spend time in the company of elephants without gaining an appreciation for their extraordinary intelligence. And research continues to reveal more about their remarkable capabilities. Though we tend to consider personal names as uniquely human, emerging research suggests that elephants may have their own version of individual-specific calls. As I observed this herd on the march across a dusty plain in Kenya, it was easy to imagine how individual "names" could play a role in maintaining contact and facilitating communication over vast distances. It all adds another intriguing dimension to our understanding of these socially complex animals. To see more of my work, follow me @beverlyjoubert.
