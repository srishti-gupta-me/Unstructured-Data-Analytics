Photo by Daniella Zalcman @dzalcman | This is Francis “Frannie” White, a member of the Coeur d’Alene tribe in Idaho. She attended the Mary Immaculate School at the Mission of the Sacred Heart in DeSmet. “One of the first things my grandmother told me when I was getting ready to go to boarding school was, ‘When the nuns beat on you, don’t give them the pleasure of seeing you cry.’ I asked, ‘So what do I do?’ She said, ‘Laugh.’”

Frannie had a horrific experience at boarding school and, at one point in the 1980s as an adult, went to the site of the old school with matches and gasoline, intent on burning down the building. She didn’t go through with it, but in 2011, when the school was destroyed in a fire, she said she celebrated. Frannie is now an active elder in her community, attending Coeur d’Alene language classes multiple times a week and taking long walks around nearby lakes. “I’ve been learning who I am and how to be comfortable with who I am and to take pride in who I am. I’m still going through that process. But we have to learn about what has been stolen from us. Was it stolen, or is it just sleeping?”
