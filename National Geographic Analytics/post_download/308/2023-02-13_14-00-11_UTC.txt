Photo by Prasenjeet Yadav @prasen.yadav | The snow leopard evolved to live in the high-elevation desert of India's Himalayan range, and every part of its body shows adaptations to this environment. Take the nose, for example. Large nostrils and a broad nasal cavity make it easier for the snow leopard to inhale large amounts of oxygen-poor mountain air. The nasal cavity houses particularly large and thick mazes of bone and tissue called turbinates. When a snow leopard inhales freezing air into the turbinates, the air becomes heated as it mixes with warm air exiting the lungs. Now that's an incredible life hack that evolution has provided to these big cats. Follow me at @prasen.yadav for more photos from India.
