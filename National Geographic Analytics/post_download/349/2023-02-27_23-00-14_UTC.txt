Photo by Muhammed Muheisen @mmuheisen | This is Hamzeh, a lion that was rescued from a zoo outside Aleppo, Syria, in 2017. Since then he has been rehabilitated and is living at the Al Ma’wa Wildlife Reserve in Jerash, Jordan. The reserve belongs to Al Ma’wa for Nature and Wildlife, part of the Princess Alia Foundation that provides emergency medical treatment, rehabilitation, and rehoming for animals.
