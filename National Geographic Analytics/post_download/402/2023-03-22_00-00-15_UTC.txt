Photo by Keith Ladzinski @ladzinski | A cluster of giant sequoia trees frames a towering white pine under the stars in California's Sequoia National Park. Giant sequoias are among the tallest and oldest trees on Earth and can be found only along a small portion of the Sierra Nevada. They are curiously specific, growing between an altitude of 4,000 and 8,000 feet (1,200 and 2,400 m) and solely on the western side of the mountain range. The fully mature trees can drink upwards of 500 gallons (1,900 L) of water a day, and their bark can be up to 3 feet (1 m) thick to shield them from ground fires.
