Photo by @martinedstrom | Nylon nets are commonly used—and frequently replaced—on the Ganges, one of the world’s largest inland fisheries. When lost or discarded in the river, the nets can entangle turtles, otters, and endangered river dolphins. Over time, they break down into microplastics. Photographed along the Ganges River during the 2019 @insidenatgeo "Plastic: Sea to Source" expedition in India. Follow @martinedstrom for more stories on plastic and its impact on our planet.
