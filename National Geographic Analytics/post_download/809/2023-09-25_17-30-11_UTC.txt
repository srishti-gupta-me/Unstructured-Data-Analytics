Photo by Ian Teh @iantehphotography | After our arrival to Cape Horn, Chilean naval officer Andrés Morales and his family met us near its shores—the only living souls on this island. Visitors here are rare, barring the occasional passing cruise ship or, at this particular time, adventurous scientists, a writer, and me—as we set off to explore the island away from the shelter of this outpost. 

In the coming days, Morales would keep us abreast of conditions by radio on an island notorious for its gales and unpredictable weather. Before setting off, I asked to take a family portrait outside during a lull in the gusts buffeting their cozy home. Admittedly I was hoping for an opportunity to catch them in the elements. They were kind and generous, willing to spend time with me as I placed them at a spot that showed the vastness and isolation of where they were. Within minutes, the winds picked up, ruffling their gracious poses to produce an image of a windswept family trying desperately to look at my camera. 

I had hoped to capture a sense of the place they were in—an isolated island at the bottom of the world. Cape Horn delivered. Later we hiked through gales and sheet rain, slipping on penguin guano before plummeting to our necks in prickly shrubs. All this in search of the world’s southernmost tree.
