Photo by David Chancellor @chancellordavid | I’ve spoken before about my work documenting the rewilding of Saudi Arabia and the Arabian leopard as a powerful symbol of restoration and regeneration. I’ve spent days and days sitting calmly, waiting and watching these magnificent creatures. Although it can be frustrating (I’m not a patient person), I’m extremely happy to find that my work is becoming more difficult, more complex, with the arrival of each new cub. Here, we see the latest one. 

Born at the Arabian leopard breeding center in Taif, Saudi Arabia, these apex predators will one day be released back into this ecosystem. The center is operated by the Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU). This winter, RCU is releasing more than 1,500 Arabian gazelles, sand gazelles, Arabian oryx, and Nubian ibex into their ancestral habitat. The last piece of the puzzle will be the return of the Arabian leopard. Before that happens, the land will need to be re-greened to support the prey, as the pyramid of a functioning ecosystem rises from the desert sand. One day, this leopard will sit in these mountains and watch from a great distance as people walk by, unaware of its presence. Until then, the longer it takes for me to see it here, the better its chances of survival are in the wild. 

Today, February 10, marks the second Arabian Leopard Day, which sheds light on the plight of this majestic creature and the conservation work under way to ensure its survival. To see more on this story, follow me @chancellordavid.
