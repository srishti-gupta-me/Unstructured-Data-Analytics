Photo by @macstonephoto | Let's set the record straight on one of the most maligned reptiles in the United States, the cottonmouth. They are feared and loathed by many, but these animals don't want anything to do with people. This scene might induce terrorâ€”and it's supposed to. Their namesake comes from a generous warning display of opening wide to signal their venomous bite. If you're close enough to see the white of their mouths, it's their way of politely asking you to back away. Also called a water moccasin, the snake is essential to wetland ecosystems, preying on rodents, fish, and even other snakes. I think they're beautiful, and I always get excited when I see one curled up on a log or along a trail. For more images from swamps and wetlands, follow @macstonephoto.
