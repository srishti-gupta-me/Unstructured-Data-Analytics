Photo by @beverlyjoubert | Kenya’s wilderness areas may be a stronghold for Africa’s lions, but no country on the continent remains untouched by the challenges facing these majestic predators. The statistics can often feel disheartening and overwhelming. According to some estimates, lion numbers have dropped by 43% over the past 21 years, and many of the remaining 62 wild lion populations are now precariously small. Yet it is also true that dedicated, determined conservation efforts really can make a difference. In certain parts of Africa, there have been encouraging successes in revitalizing populations, bringing these predators back to areas where they had long been absent. What is urgently needed is the restoration of natural landscapes and the creation of interconnected wildlife corridors, so that lions can regain the critical space they need to thrive.
