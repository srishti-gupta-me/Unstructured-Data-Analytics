Photo by @nicholesobecki | This April 2020 image features Daniel Owino, a musician who goes by the name Futwax, and his four-year-old son, Julian Austin, as they performed his ballad “Have you sanitized?” As fear of the COVID-19 virus began to grow, Futwax, who lives in the Kibera area of Nairobi, Kenya, decided he could help though his music. “We have to be our own solution," he says. 

I’m grateful to have been able to call Nairobi home for the last 12 years, and to have the opportunity to document this difficult moment for the city and world through the eyes of people like Daniel. To learn more about the remarkable world we share, follow along @nicholesobecki.
