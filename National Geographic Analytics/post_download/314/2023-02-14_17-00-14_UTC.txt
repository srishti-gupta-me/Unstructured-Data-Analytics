Photo by @brianskerry | A female humpback whale and her newborn calf (estimated to be two days old) swim in the waters off Rarotonga in the Cook Islands. Humpback whale mothers invest a great deal of energy into their calves. The gestation period is about a year long, and once the calf is born, mom spends another year teaching it all the skills it will need to survive. Stay tuned for more images of love celebrating #ValentinesDay.
