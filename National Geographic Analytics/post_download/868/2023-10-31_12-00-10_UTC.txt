Photo by @joelsartore | This 24-day-old slow loris I photographed at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center in Vietnam was named Captain Hook by his care team because of his missing hand. Loris species are unique among primates in part because of their looks, but more so because they are classified as a venomous mammal. Each individual has a patch filled with venom under its elbow. When a predator encounter occurs, the loris will coat its teeth by licking this spot in order to deliver a venom-laced bite. To see more species featured in the Photo Ark, follow me @joelsartore. #PhotoArk
