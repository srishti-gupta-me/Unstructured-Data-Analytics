Photo by @joelsartore | Happy World Chimpanzee Day from Ruben, a three-month-old baby chimp at Zoo Tampa. Though you can’t tell from this photo, his adoptive human "mom" was holding him from the waist down to keep him relaxed and hamming it up during our brief photo shoot. He was being hand raised by zoo staff after being rejected by his biological mother, and had largely the same needs as a human baby—including constant attention, being held, and talked to. It’s no wonder: along with bonobos, chimps are our closest living relatives, sharing 98.7 percent of our genetic blueprint.
