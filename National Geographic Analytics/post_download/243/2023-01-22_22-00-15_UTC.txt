Photo by Laura Morton @laurakmorton | Fueled by snacks and energy drinks, competitors in a hackathon organized at Hacker Dojo, a Silicon Valley community technology hub, stayed up late into the night working on their projects. I photographed the scene while on assignment for National Geographic to capture the culture of the Silicon Valley. These events, which play an integral role in the tech industry, bring software developers and others together to collaborate intensively on a programming hack over a set period of time. While the focus is unique to each hackathon, the goal is usually the same: to create a piece of functioning software or hardware by the end, often in competition for prizes. For more photographs of people and places, follow along @laurakmorton.
