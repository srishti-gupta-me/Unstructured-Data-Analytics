There is something unusual about Drunken Forest, as you can see. In certain parts of the cave, the stalagmites lean. On first impression, they look like they were formed at an angle, but that's not the case. It's thought that an earthquake many years ago tilted the stalagmites. Here, researchers Gina Moseley from the University of Innsbruck and Nele Meckler of Bergen University take a drip-water sample from a stalagmite.
