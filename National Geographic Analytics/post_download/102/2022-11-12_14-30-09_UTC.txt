The base offered the team a starting point to access nearby caves, where the scientists had several sampling sites. At the end of each long and tiring day, it was an amazing feeling to relax while gazing up at the white cliffs of limestone—which reveal several cave entrances. I had climbed to them, exploring the maze of passages inside the mountain, on previous expeditions some 10 years ago.
