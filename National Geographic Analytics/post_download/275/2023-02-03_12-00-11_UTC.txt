Save the Manatee Club's Cora Berchem and Wayne Hartley do a daily count and general health checks during the winter. They can distinguish the manatees by their body scars from injuries such as being struck by boats. Having done this work for more than 30 years, Hartley has memorized hundreds of scar patterns.
