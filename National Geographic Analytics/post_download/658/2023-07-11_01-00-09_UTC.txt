Many products on the market promise to keep away mosquitoes, ticks, and other bothersome bugs. But which products best protect against them? Not all repellents are created equal, and some don’t work at all. The repellent you might want to use depends on where you live, how long you’ll be outdoors, and which bugs you’re trying to repel.

DEET and permethrin are EPA-approved repellents, have a relatively low environmental toxicity, and are safe for humans in accepted doses. Other products such as citronella candles, essential oils, zappers, and ultrasonic devices may be EPA-certified but are less effective. Head to the link in bio to learn more.
