Photo by Orsolya Haarberg @fjellheimengalleri | After spending a cold night at 2,100 meters (6,900 ft) above sea level, my friend Signe Kvarberg and I woke up in our bivy bags surrounded by thick fog on Mount Loftet in Norway. It was magical to see the clouds open up in the higher regions and make “waves” around the snow-covered Smørstabbtindane in the early morning hours. The group of mountains is part of Jotunheimen National Park. This image is part of my exhibition “REiN—Inspired by Nordic Nature,” on view in Vågå, Norway, this summer.
