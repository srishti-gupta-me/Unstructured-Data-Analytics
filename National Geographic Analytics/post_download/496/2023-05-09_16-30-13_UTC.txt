Photo by Reuben Wu @reuben | Caddo Lake, located on the border with Louisiana, is the largest natural lake in Texas, covering 26,000 acres (10,500 ha)â€”and also home to the largest cypress forest in the world. Wispy Spanish moss adorns the branches of the trees, and the slow-moving currents result in a reddish brown water loaded with nutrients that fall from the trees, supporting a rich ecosystem of wildlife. 

This is a composite of multiple images; the tree is illuminated by a drone-mounted light. For more photos, follow me @reuben.
