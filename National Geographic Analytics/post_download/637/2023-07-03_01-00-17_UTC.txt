Photo by @estherhorvath | In April I had the opportunity to visit the Eureka Weather Station, a small research base with eight staff on Ellesmere Island, in the Canadian territory of Nunavut. Eureka was founded in 1947 as the first official high Arctic weather station in Canada. Weather balloons, like the one seen here, are launched twice a day (11:15 a.m. and 11:15 p.m. GMT) to collect data such as wind speed and direction, temperature, pressure, and relative humidity up to an altitude of about 35 kilometers (20 mi). Follow me @estherhorvath for more polar science stories.
