Photo by @jasperdoest | The killer whale (orca) is found in all the world's oceans, and although it's considered a single species, research by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Antarctic waters has identified four distinct forms of killer whales, known as types A, B, C, and D. Through satellite tagging, NOAA will study the movements of the whales. Tissue samples are also being collected to compare dietary signals, contaminant loads, and genetic differences. A photo database will also help in identification and to estimate population sizes and residency patterns. This research is being conducted in collaboration with the National Geographic Society and Lindblad Expeditions.
