Photo by @martinschoeller | In 2022 I began a series photographing and sharing the experiences of Native peoples in America. The portraits were taken at Albuquerque's Gathering of Nations, the largest powwow in North America. This is Percy Edwards, from the Colville Confederated Tribe: 

"My whole family lives on the reservation. My brother has danced all his life; my mom was a shaman, a medicine woman. In '03 my brother comes to me and says, 'Fill out this paperwork for eagle feathers.’ I am going, ‘what?’ I had shunned the Native life; I was a businessman living in faraway California. I had been the CEO of two companies, but still I gave the order and sent it to the fish and game department in Colorado. Three years later, a big box showed up with dry ice and I pulled out a frozen bald eagle.

So I started plucking the feathers and at night I start dreaming of dancing with the Old Ones. One morning I woke up, I saw  face paint on me and a badger on my head. I turned to my wife and said, 'I want to start dancing.'" 

Edwards's passage refers to the ability of Native Americans to apply to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for access to eagle carcasses, parts, and feathers, which are used for ceremonial or religious purposes.

Thank you Percy Edwards for your words and time. For more portraits and stories in this series, follow me @martinschoeller.
