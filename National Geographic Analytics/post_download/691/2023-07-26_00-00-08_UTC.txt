In 1847, British explorer Sir John Franklin and his crew disappeared while searching for the fabled Northwest Passage. A National Geographic team sought to find evidence of their fate—but not without obstacles of their own. The team sailed from the Atlantic into a mazelike network of channels toward the other side of the continent, off the coast of Alaska. Along the way, their boat became trapped in a labyrinth of ice floes, and with winter approaching, they—much like the ill-fated Franklin expedition—risked being stranded in the Arctic.
