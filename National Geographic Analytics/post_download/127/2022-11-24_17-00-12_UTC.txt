Photo by @sarahyltonphoto | In a remote region of northern Ontario, Canada, Ana Moonias plays on land belonging to the Neskantaga First Nation while her family is off hunting partridge. Neskantaga is connected only by air from Thunder Bay or by ice roads—frozen rivers and waterways that are maintained for winter travel. The region is located near the "ring of fire," an area known to be rich in deposits of copper, platinum, chromite, and nickel—resources the Ontario government is eager to capitalize on.
