Photo by @enricsala | A silky shark is seen off the coast of Gabon in 2012. I was on a research and filming expedition, in collaboration with the Waitt Foundation and the Wildlife Conservation Society, to help formulate the creation of marine protected areas. Shortly after, Gabon designated marine reserves that protected 28% of its waters, providing a safe haven for sharks and other marine life.
