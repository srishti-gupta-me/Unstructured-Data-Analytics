Photo by @javier_aznar_photography | Detail of an orchid (Lepanthes sp.) photographed at Tapichalaca, a protected reserve in southern Ecuador. The reserve was founded in 1997 in order to protect a rare bird, Grallaria ridgelyi, an endangered antpitta. But the place is home to other threatened species like the Tapichalaca torrenter frog, the mountain tapir, and the Andean bear.  It's also one of the most diverse hot spots in the Andes for orchid species. Many are new to science and also under pressure from an illegal trade.
