Photo by @amivitale | Ntipiyon Nonguta and her son Bernard, 1, relax with neighbors as they make beaded belts for the Loisaba Community Trust in Ewaso, a village on Kenya's Laikipia Plateau. These women are part of a community surrounding the Loisaba Conservancy. They're supported and given access to markets for their goods, and revenue from ecotourism is reinvested into Ewaso and other villages.
