Photo by Keith Ladzinski @ladzinski | The autumn season is always a bit wistful. Witnessing the fleeting beauty of changing leaves signifies shorter and colder days ahead. For deciduous trees and shrubs, this shedding is a process of preparation. The first act for these plants is to slow and eventually stop producing chlorophyll, the key ingredient that gives foliage its green color and helps absorb light for photosynthesis. Shedding is a safeguard against heavy snow that can cling to leaves and cause severe damage. I photographed this scene of vibrant red maple leaves in northern Illinois after the first snow of the season, a collision of autumn and winter.
