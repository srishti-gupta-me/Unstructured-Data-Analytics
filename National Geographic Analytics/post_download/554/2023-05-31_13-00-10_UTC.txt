Photo by @joelsartore | North American river otters are built for life on the water. Thick, protective fur keeps them warm as they navigate chilly waters; short legs and webbed feet make them incredibly fast swimmers; and a long, narrow body and flattened head help streamline their movements. Otters like this one @wildlifecenterastoria are also capable of staying underwater for up to eight minutes, during which time they can use their long whiskers to help them detect prey.
