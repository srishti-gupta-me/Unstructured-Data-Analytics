Photo by Reuben Wu @reuben | An enormous boulder outcrop in Bolivia's Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve is illuminated by a light-carrying drone during a long exposure. Located in the Altiplano, the dunes and rocks of the Siloli Desert have been eroded by wind-blown sand over millennia. For more photos and stories, follow me @reuben.
