Photo by @javier_aznar_photography | Four little owls (Athene noctua) perch on top of a rock at sunrise in Castilla–La Mancha, Spain. In the middle of summer, these chicks stay together, close to their fathers, exploring the surroundings of the nest and learning to survive in a hostile habitat. By summer’s end, they will all separate from one another, looking for their own territory.  These sedentary birds inhabit northern Africa and parts of Europe and Asia.
