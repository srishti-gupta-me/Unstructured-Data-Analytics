Photo by @joelsartore | These remarkable-looking creatures are endangered golden snub-nosed monkeys I photographed at Ocean Park Hong Kong. This species, living in the montane forests of southwestern China where snow can last for up to four months every winter, can withstand the coldest average temperatures of any nonhuman primate in the world. Though it hasnâ€™t been confirmed through research, some scientists believe the peculiar shape of their nose, especially the flaps of skin above their high-arching nostrils, aids in protecting against frostbite. To see more species featured in the Photo Ark, follow me, @joelsartore. @hkoceanpark
