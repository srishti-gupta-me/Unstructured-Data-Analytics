Photo by David Chancellor @chancellordavid | I remember as a child that "snow days" were simply unique. It was as if an extra day had been given to us all. I had the same feeling recently when I arose well before dawn to find the African bush blanketed in fog. It wasn't a reason to slip back under the duvet; rather, it was a gift. Imagine for a moment that all that has evolved to predate and to disappear from its prey's view now has the assistance of fog. Then things can get really interesting.
