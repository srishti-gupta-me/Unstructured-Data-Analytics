Photo by @acacia.johnson | A young polar bear peers beneath the sea ice near Spitsbergen, in Norway's Svalbard archipelago. These marine mammals are capable of swimming long distances and depend on sea ice to hunt for food. This young bear appeared to be playing with the skin of a seal it had recently eaten, tossing it into the water then swimming down to bring it back to the surface.
