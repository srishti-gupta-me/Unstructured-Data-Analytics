Photo by @enricsala | Dominica is a nation in the Caribbean known as Nature Island. Most people think that’s because of its verdant tropical forest. But in the waters around the island there is another natural—and national—treasure: a resident population of approximately 200 sperm whales. These citizens of Dominica support the local ecotourism industry and help mitigate climate change.

Being in the presence of these gentle giants is nothing short of spiritual. Here, Pristine Seas underwater cinematographer Manu San Félix (@manusanfelix) free dives to film a pod of sleeping sperm whales. One of the whales had a giant squid tentacle hanging from its mouth.
