Photo by @michaelchristopherbrown | A goat herder stands for a portrait near the town of Ngiko, just outside of Virunga National Park headquarters in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The park is Africa’s most biodiverse protected area, home to over a thousand mammal, bird, reptile, and amphibian species as well as 1/3 of the world’s endangered mountain gorillas. Virunga is known as the park of fire and ice for its diverse habitats ranging from the Rwenzori peaks to savanna and volcanic plains. Despite its status, Virunga is constantly threatened by war, poaching and other illegal activities, and natural disasters. With the support of donors, the Virunga Foundation actively conserves the park, which spans over 3,000 square miles (7,800 sq km). Over 5 million people reside within a day’s walk of it, many living in extreme poverty and enduring more than 30 years of conflict. The fertile lands in and around Virunga are prime for agricultural exploitation. By preserving the land, many of the world’s poorest are forced to sacrifice opportunity. To tackle this social justice issue, with the support of the EU, Virunga National Park has founded an initiative to foster a locally-led "green" economy based on ecotourism, sustainable agriculture, and energy.
