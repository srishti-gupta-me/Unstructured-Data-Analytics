Photo by @mattiasklumofficial | The experience of silently moving through the ancient rainforest of the Danum Valley in Malaysian Borneo is amazing. It's a world brimming with species that have unique adaptations. I've spent so much time in this ecosystem it has a special place in my heart. Every day you can see something new. If you're patient and careful, you might be rewarded by finding creatures like this whip snake on a branch near your face! Follow me at @mattiasklumofficial for more stories and images of incredible and endangered creatures. #borneo #danumvalley #whipsnake #protectbiodiversity #savetherainforest
