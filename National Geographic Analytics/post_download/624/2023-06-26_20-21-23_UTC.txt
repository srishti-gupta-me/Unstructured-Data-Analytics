Photo by @laurakmorton | An annual summer tradition, firemenâ€™s carnivals can be found in small towns across the United States, where rural communities often rely on a volunteer firefighting force. They must fundraise to purchase firefighting equipment, and the carnivals are a major contributor. In 2021 I photographed the Walkersville Volunteer Fire Company carnival in Walkersville, Maryland, while working on a project about American celebrations. Carnival attendees walk through the midway right before a thunderstorm passed over. For more photographs of people and places, follow along @laurakmorton.
