Photo by @joelsartore | When they’re born, coyote puppies are blind and limp-eared. It isn’t until they are around 10 days old that their eyes open and their ears begin to stand erect. Pups like these at Nebraska Wildlife Rehab won’t finish growing until they're between 9 and 12 months old, at which point males will venture off on their own, while females will remain with their parents and form the basis of the pack.
