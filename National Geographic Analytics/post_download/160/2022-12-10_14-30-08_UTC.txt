Photo by Mattias A. Klum @mattiasklumofficial | Melting natural sculptures of ice in Grey Lake at Torres del Paine National Park in Chile. While taking a series of images here, I went a bit too far, and my tripod lost its grip. To avoid jeopardizing the camera gear, I fell in insteadâ€”quite a brisk experience! My great friend and assistant at the time, Lars-Magnus, helped pull me out of the ice-cold water. The amazing blue color in the back is caused by the ice absorbing red light, or long wavelengths, and scattering back and transmitting blue light, or short wavelengths.
