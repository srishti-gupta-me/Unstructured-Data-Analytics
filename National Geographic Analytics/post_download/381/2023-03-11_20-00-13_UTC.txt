Photo by @nadiashiracohen | When Phalla became a surrogate for a middle-class Chinese couple, she never imagined that the baby growing in her belly would be for keeps. Yet when the housing complex she lived in—run by the agency that placed her—was raided by police and she was arrested, along with 30 other surrogates, her life would change forever. Though there was no law on surrogacy in Cambodia, to discourage the practice it was treated as a form of human trafficking. The women were sentenced to raise, under supervision, the children they later bore. Phalla has come to love her daughter unconditionally as one of her own.
