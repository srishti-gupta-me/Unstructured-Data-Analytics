Photo by @rubensalgadoescudero | Maung Ko, an ethnic Shan farmer, poses with his cow in the village of Lui Pan Sone in Kayah State, Myanmar (Burma). Solar lamps let him milk his cows early in the morning or late in the evenings, freeing up his days to spend more time with his family or working in the fields. Around 50% of the population in Myanmar have access to electricity, the vast majority of which live in cities, according to most recent data from the International Energy Agency. Access is even bleaker in rural areas, where only 3,000 of the estimated 68,000 villages in the countryâ€™s rural areas have access to the power source.
