Photo by @beverlyjoubert | So much curiosity and wide-eyed wonder in that feline face. And yet the wilderness that stands to be explored and ruled over by these top predators shrinks with every passing year. Africa’s lions have been eradicated from 90% of their historic range due to poaching, habitat loss, and conflict with humans. In the pockets of sub-Saharan Africa where they still maintain strongholds, their future is increasingly uncertain. Protecting and expanding space for lions to roam safely has been at the heart of my conservation work for decades. It’s simply impossible to imagine an Africa without them.
