Photo by @joelsartore | This fiery-colored bird is a crimson topaz hummingbird I photographed while visiting Weltvogelpark, a bird park in Walsrode, Germany. Found in the rainforests of northeastern South America, this hummingbird species uses its bright colors to mark and defend territory, with males flashing their feathers toward potential intruders. The species is predominantly solitary, and a male's territory includes his mate and their chicksâ€”no other males or mated pairs from the same species are allowed. To see more species featured in the Photo Ark, follow me @joelsartore. @weltvogelpark #PhotoArk
