Photo by @reuben | Today’s annular eclipse looms behind a hiker at the top of a pinnacle in Nevada's Schell Creek Range. An annular eclipse differs from a total eclipse in that the moon is slightly further away from Earth and doesn’t quite cover the sun's disk, creating a dramatic crescent and ring effect, rather than the total eclipse's visible corona amid full darkness.
