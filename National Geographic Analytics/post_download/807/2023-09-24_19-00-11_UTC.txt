Photo by @amytoensing | Monhegan Island, Maine, 1999: American artist Jamie Wyeth works on a painting of island resident Kyle Murdock with his sign offering various items for sale to tourists—among them, a tour of his Dead Cat Museum, a collection of mummified cats Kyle found under a house on the island. Wyeth, who owns a summer home on Monhegan, has painted the island and its residents for decades, including a series on the children of the island.

This image is from my first story for National Geographic magazine, about Monhegan, a small island 10 miles off the coast of Maine. Two miles long and half a mile wide, the island overflows with tourists in the summer, but the year-round population is only about 60 to 70. The islanders’ de facto fishing territory became the Monhegan Lobster Conservation Area in 1996 with a limited season starting in October. The island’s windswept landscape, quirky community, and dramatic cliffs have inspired artists Robert Henri, George Bellows, Rockwell Kent, Edward Hopper, Lynne Mapp Drexler, and three generations of Wyeths, to name a few.
