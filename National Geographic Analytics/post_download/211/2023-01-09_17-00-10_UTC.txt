Photo by @brianskerry | A male-and-female pair of “toothy” Atlantic wolffish inside their den in the waters of the Gulf of Maine. This species is perfectly suited for cold water, as their blood contains natural compounds that prevent it from freezing. Atlantic wolffish are undergoing steep population declines because of overfishing and climate change (warming seawater temperatures), which have already led to local extinction and range contraction. #GulfofMaine #climatechange
