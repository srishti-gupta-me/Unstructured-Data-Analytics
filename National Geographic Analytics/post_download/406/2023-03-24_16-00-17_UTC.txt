Photo by @beverlyjoubert | A lush, flamboyant mane may be the ultimate physical status symbol in lion society—and this male in the remote northern reaches of Botswana’s famed Okavango Delta is certainly well endowed in that department. But it’s a status symbol that comes with a definite downside. Bushier manes—especially those of the dark, heat-absorbing variety—can be hard on the wearer in sweltering southern Africa, especially as average temperatures rise due to climate change. Research suggests lions sporting thicker, darker manes may need to compensate with cooling tactics like drinking more water or taking longer breaks in the shade compared to their less hairy counterparts.
