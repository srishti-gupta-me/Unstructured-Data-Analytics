Photo by Robin Hammond @hammond_robin | “I had to flee Uganda, because my life was in danger,” says Tasha, a transgender woman. She went to Kenya, hoping she’d find safety and acceptance. She quickly came to realize that transphobia was a real threat there too. “I only move out if it’s really important—very, very important—because I’m scared for my life.” Tasha posed for my long-term project, Where Love Is Illegal. She appears on the cover of my new book of the same name. You can see her story and many others at @whereloveisillegal. 

This portrait was photographed using a large-format camera on instant film.
