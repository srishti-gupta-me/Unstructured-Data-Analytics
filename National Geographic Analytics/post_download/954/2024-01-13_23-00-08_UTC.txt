Photo by @sofia_jaramillo5 | Two skiers cross Jackson Lake at sunrise in Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park. The high-altitude lake freezes over in winter, providing backcountry access to the northern part of the national park. For skiers and snowboarders climbing and descending iconic routes like Mount Moran, the adventure often starts at Jackson Lake. For more images, follow me @sofia_jaramillo5.
