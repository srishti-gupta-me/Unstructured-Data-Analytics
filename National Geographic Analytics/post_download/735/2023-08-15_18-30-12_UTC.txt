Photo by Robbie Shone @shonephoto | We have just returned home from exploring some of the most northern caves on Earth for science. We have a lot to digest as we prepare to unveil our discoveries. In the meantime, here is a photograph, taken on this trip, from a typical arid valley from the vast Wulff Land peninsula, located right in the middle of the north of Greenland. Stay tuned as thereâ€™s a lot more to come from a very, very remote part of our planet. @greenland_caves
