Humans rarely visit this beautiful corner of Northeast Greenland National Park, but the region is home to thousands of musk oxen and healthy populations of polar bears and Arctic foxes. This is also one of many valleys where meltwater from the Greenland ice sheet leaves land and enters the sea. For the past several summers, I’ve joined oceanographers from Aarhus University and the Flanders Marine Institute while they installed sensors to measure conditions in these fjords. These sensors provide critical insights about when and how much fresh water is entering the oceans, even when nobody is around to see it. For more from northeast Greenland, follow along at @jtkerby.
