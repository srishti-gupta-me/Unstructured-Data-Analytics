Photo by @filipe_deandrade | Big Bend is a photographer's dream. Wide-ranging landscapes, golden hours that clock overtime, and wildlife as charismatic as the land itself. While immersed in its grandeur, it's easy to imagine the time of the dinosaurs. You could spend an entire lifetime in the park and discover something new every day. As a photographer I try to take what nature gives me, and on this day, nature gave me a fireworks show. It was one of those sunrises that kept getting better and better, but it made choosing a frame difficult. Everywhere I pointed the camera there seemed to be a brushstroke of brilliance that made me second-guess my previous frame. What I love about this frame is that it shows the diverse ecosystem that is Big Bend. A brief hike in from the side of the road, this location is both beautiful and accessible, which seems to be the theme here! It's a choose-your-own-adventure kind of place, as difficult or easy as you want to experience it. All thatâ€™s important is that you embrace your wild side and allow nature to sit in the driver's seat.
