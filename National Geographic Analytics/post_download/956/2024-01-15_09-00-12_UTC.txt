Photo by @beverlyjoubert | The intensity. The razor focus. The muscles honed to perfection. It takes physical power, tenacity, and great skill to execute a successful hunt in the swamps of Botswana’s famed Okavango Delta. It's not surprising that the demands—and the bountiful offerings—of this unique environment shape lions that are among the largest and strongest on Earth. The delta also represents one of the last strongholds for an apex predator that increasingly finds itself hemmed by encroaching human activity and diminishing habitat. Lions are now confined to a mere 8% of their historic range. If we want to secure their future, we must protect the fragile wildernesses that still sustain them.
