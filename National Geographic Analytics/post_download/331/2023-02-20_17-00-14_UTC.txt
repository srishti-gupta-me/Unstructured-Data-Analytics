Photo by @beverlyjoubert | A bad "hair" day can afflict us all… The black heron may look comically disheveled here, but its hunting savvy is nothing to snigger at—and the watery landscapes of Botswana’s Okavango Delta are the perfect place to deploy one of the most ingenious and crafty fishing tactics in the avian world. The bird's "umbrella" method (also known as canopy feeding) involves spreading out those dark wings to create a shadowy trap for unsuspecting prey. Drawn in by the illusion of a shady hideaway, fish are soon dispatched by a few flicks of the heron's beak.
