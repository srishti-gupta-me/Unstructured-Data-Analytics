Photo by @rubensalgadoescudero | Ko Win Zaw Oo, 38, a fisher and father of two, stands by his boat in Lui Pan Sone village, located in Myanmar's Kayah state. Ko Win uses solar power to prep his boat at night, when he's able to catch more fish. According to recent data from the International Energy Agency, around 50% of Myanmar's people have access to electricity, the vast majority in cities. Of the estimated 68,000 villages in the country, just 3,000 or so have any sort of access to power.

This is part of my ongoing Solar Portraits project, which focuses on electricity access and the impact of solar power in different communities. Follow me @rubensalgadoescudero to see the world through my lens.
