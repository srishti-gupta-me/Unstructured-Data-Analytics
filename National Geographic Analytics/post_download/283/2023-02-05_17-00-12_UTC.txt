With a two-decade-long drought gripping the western United States, water levels in Lake Powell have plummeted, particularly during the last two years. A silver lining to the water crisis: over 100,000 acres (40,000 ha) of Glen Canyon are now out from under the artificial lake, revealing natural wonders such as La Gorce. As the waters retreat, a flood of flora and fauna is appearing at a pace greater than scientists anticipated, which brings hope for the restoration of one of America’s lost natural wonders—Glen Canyon. Follow me @elliotstudio as I continue to explore stories surrounding the Colorado River Basin.
