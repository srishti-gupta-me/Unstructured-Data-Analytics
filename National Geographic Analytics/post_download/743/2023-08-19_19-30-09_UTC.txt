Photo by @joelsartore | The International Wolf Center in Ely, Minnesota, had a "study pack" of wolves in an outdoor enclosure. Researchers could observe their behavior year round, and tourists would stop by to see if they could get a glimpse.

I asked what the wolves ate. One of the biologists said the roads department would bring road-killed deer up a couple times a week. They'd throw the entire carcass in, then let the wolves tear it up and devour it just as they would in the wild. I thought this might make a good opportunity for a remotely operated camera. I called it "The Carcasscam."

I was there for a week, which gave me two opportunities to embed a small, radio-triggered camera next to the carcass. The NG Photo Engineering Lab created a heavy plexiglass sphere with a lens port, into which the camera was placed. The device was wide enough so a wolf couldn’t get its jaws around it and crush it. The bottom of the sphere had a tripod mount so the rig could be screwed into a sheet of plywood that we placed the deer on.

The first time I tried it, all I got were pictures of the wolves’ furry throats as they ate the deer from the back side of the camera.

Two or three days later, when the second deer was brought into the pen, I moved the deer and camera to the opposite side, with lots of open plywood behind the camera. I figured the wolves would not want to walk on a hard, strange surface like that, and I was right. This time they approached to eat facing the camera, with their paws never leaving the snow. 

This photo was made at the moment the alpha wolf, a female, was snarling at pack mates to stay away until she'd eaten. The blurry area on her throat was where she'd licked the lens port, trying to figure out what it was before tearing into her meal.
