Photo by Muhammed Muheisen @mmuheisen | Traumatized and neglected animals rescued from mismanaged zoos, confiscated from smugglers, and saved from war zones find a second chance at Al Ma'wa for Nature and Wildlife, a wildlife sanctuary in Jordan. 

Seen here is Yerga, a 10-year-old African lion that has lived with his four siblings at Al Maâ€™wa for a decade. He was rescued when he was just four days old. This image is part of my story "Unlikely Refugees," published in the August 2023 issue of National Geographic magazine. Read the full story at the link in bio.
