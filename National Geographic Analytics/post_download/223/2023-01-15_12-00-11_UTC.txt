Photo by @paoloverzone | A polar bear walks across the frozen sea, approaching a passenger cruise ship in Greenland. Polar bears live and breed in the northernmost regions of eastern Greenland. Each year, many bears drift southward with the ice along the coast. Sea ice melts and disappears quickly as the Arctic warmsâ€”twice as fast as the rest of the planet. When the sea ice disappears, polar bears have to move onto land, where there are fewer feeding opportunities. Follow @paoloverzone for more images and stories.
