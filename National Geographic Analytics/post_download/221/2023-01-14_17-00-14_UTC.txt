Photo by @beverlyjoubert | The marshes, channels, and deep lagoons of Botswana’s Okavango Delta provide a rich habitat patchwork for so many wild creatures—biodiversity on a scale that's hard to match. Cruising the delta’s winding waterways or basking in the sun along the banks, crocodiles are truly at home here—and top of the food chain. They’re so perfectly evolved for this watery lifestyle that little about these predators has changed for millions of years. And it’s no wonder that many of the delta’s other animal inhabitants approach the water’s edge with a healthy dose of apprehension. #crocodiles #okavango #nilecrocodile #wildlife
