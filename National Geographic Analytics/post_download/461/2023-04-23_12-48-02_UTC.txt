Photo by Elliot Ross @elliotstudio | As day breaks, early spring’s first light spills across a wild land of canyons, spires, mesas, and arches. Canyonlands in Utah is easily one of my favorite national parks—not only because the landscape is something out of a Western legend but also because of the variety it offers. With four distinct sections, each with its own unique environment and geography, the park offers a lifetime of mazelike wilderness to explore. | For #NationalParkWeek, @GMC encourages you to explore and find your nowhere by visiting one of your local natural wonders.
