Photo by @gabrielegalimbertiphoto | This young pirate is Mikel, 3, in Bergen, Norway, photographed for my Toy Stories project. Wherever I travel in the world, I take portraits of children with their favorite toys. I've visited over 60 countries, where I've recorded the genuine joy that unites kids despite their diverse backgrounds. Whether the child owns a veritable fleet of miniature cars or a single stuffed monkey, the pride they have is moving, funny, and thought-provoking.
