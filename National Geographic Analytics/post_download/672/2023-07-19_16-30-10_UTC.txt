Photo by @nadiashiracohen | Tyrone Washington holds his three-month-old daughter, Ritcheousness, just outside the motel room he shares with his family in northern Orlando. The family's car was rear-ended by a bus, sending Tyrone to the hospital for emergency brain surgery. He was unable to work, and the family quickly found themselves homeless. With the help of a local organization, they've been able to stay in a motel until they get back on their feet. The American motel—a concept originally intended to stimulate business travel and tourism across the country—has over the years become home to many who are unable to come up with high deposits to rent apartments, or have been evicted or foreclosed on. Florida has a large percentage of the country's homeless families, who often find temporary refuge in the motels that line its tourist strips.
