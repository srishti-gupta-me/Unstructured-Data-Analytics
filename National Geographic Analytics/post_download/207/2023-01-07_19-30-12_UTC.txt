Havermans studies polar jellyfish, and in January 2022 she was the first to observe the helmet jellyfish in Arctic waters. The proliferation of jellyfish may be a result of climate change and could affect local fish populations. Jellyfish migrating from warmer waters could compete with native Arctic fish species for the same source in the food web, changing the ecosystem.
