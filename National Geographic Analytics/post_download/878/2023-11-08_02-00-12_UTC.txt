Photo by @beverlyjoubert | For a cheetah mother, rearing young is a feat of patience, resilience â€¦ and preparedness. Staying watchful and alert is how meals are found and threats from larger predators averted. Luckily, in the sprawling flatness of Kenya's Mara ecosystem, scanning the horizon for both takes just a little elevation. The ubiquitous termite mound offers the perfect perch when vigilance is required. Before very long, these two youngsters will grow to appreciate the usefulness of a lookout spot, too.
