Photo by Charlie Hamilton James @chamiltonjames | In the Indigenous Awã community of Juriti, in the Brazilian state of Maranhão, I photographed Ayhua with a black bearded saki monkey. Young monkeys such as this one cling to the hair of their hosts—a common sight as Awã women go about daily life. The Awã have a strong connection to the animals in the forests where the communities reside, particularly monkeys but also coatis and peccaries. For more go to the link in bio.
