Photo by Daniella Zalcman @dzalcman | This photo is the result of a happy accident in the wake of failure. I had traveled to the Havasupai reservation—a fairly hard-to-reach Native community at the bottom of the Grand Canyon—hoping to speak with the tribal council about an ongoing project tied to survivors of the Indian Boarding School system in the U.S. After a few hours, the council confirmed they couldn't fit me in on the agenda for that day but suggested I hike to Havasu Falls before I left. Two miles down the road, I came across this scene—one of the most beautiful landscapes I've ever seen. To read an installment of the project, go to the link in bio.
