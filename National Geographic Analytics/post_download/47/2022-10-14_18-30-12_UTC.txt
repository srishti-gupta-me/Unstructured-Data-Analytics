Photo by @gabrielegalimbertiphoto | This is Noel, 5, in Dallas, Texas. Wherever I travel in the world, I take portraits of children with their favorite toys. In five-plus years, I've visited over 60 countries, recording the genuine joy that unites kids despite their diverse backgrounds. Whether the child owns a veritable fleet of miniature cars or a single stuffed monkey, the pride they have is moving, funny, and thought-provoking.
