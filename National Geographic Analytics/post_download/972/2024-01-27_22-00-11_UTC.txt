Photo by @joelsartore | This adorable amphibian is a Malaysian golden gliding tree frog. Found across Southeast Asia, it resides in a variety of areas including cities and other built-up environments. It breeds in stagnant pools and roadside puddles, where its hungry tadpoles can devour decayed plants, invertebrates, and sometimes even one another.
