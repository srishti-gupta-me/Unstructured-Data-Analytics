Photo by @beverlyjoubert | Etched against a Kenyan sunset, the silhouette of a giraffe is one of those quintessential sights that captures the immense and unmistakable natural beauty of Africa. It is hard to imagine this continent without the presence of these graceful creatures. And yet the future of Africa’s giraffe species is increasingly uncertain, and their alarming decline has been called a silent extinction. There are now fewer giraffes than elephants or gorillas. Perhaps because they seem so very ubiquitous, their plight has not received the same level of attention as the continent’s other vulnerable species. If we want to preserve the iconic sight of these long-necked giants etched against African skies, we need to do more to raise awareness and support their conversation.
