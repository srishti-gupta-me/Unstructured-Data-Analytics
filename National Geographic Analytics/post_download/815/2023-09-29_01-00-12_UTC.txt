Photo by @orsolyahaarberg | A friend and I were determined to trek on skis to the mountaintop despite a strong gale and low visibility on this day in early April in Jotunheimen, Norway. We were pleasantly surprised by the brief moments of stillness and a short period of good visibility. The sun found its way through the cloud cover every so often and magically lit up parts of the landscape. We were spurred on to reach our goal, the top of Veslfjelltinden. After finding the right position, I had just enough time to grab my camera and capture adjacent peaks as a gust of wind and a beam of sunlight came into the scene.
