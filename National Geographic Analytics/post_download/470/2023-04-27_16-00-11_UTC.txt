Photo by @MartinEdstrom | Flying over Zambia's South Luangwa National Park is a good way to track lions living there. While the animals are hard to spot from a plane, scientists use radio collars to locate them in remote areasâ€”and flying makes it way easier to pick up the radio signals. That morning we found the Mwamba One pride, thanks to a hunch from the pilot.
