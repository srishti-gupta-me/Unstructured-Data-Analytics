Photo by @timlaman | I climbed a strangler fig tree in Borneo to capture this shot of a red leaf monkey (Presbytis rubicunda) mom and baby feeding on figs high in the rainforest canopy. The monkeys are known by many names, including maroon langur and maroon leaf monkey. Iâ€™m on my way home after working for six weeks in Indonesia on assignment for National Geographic. To see more rainforest wildlife visit me @timlaman. #borneo #indonesia #gunungpalungnationalpark #wildlifephotography #conservation #onassignment
