Photo by @estherhorvath | A polar bear passes by the Tundra Buggy Lodge, near Churchill, Canada. Polar bears are creatures of the sea ice and spend as much time as possible on it, traveling long distances in search of seals. But as the ice in Hudson Bay melts completely each summer, the region's bears shift inland, sheltering in cool, earthen dens. As winter once again approaches, the bears begin to migrate, heading for the tundra along the bay's shores to wait for the water to freeze. Their path often takes them around—or through—Churchill, making it one of the best places to spot the bears. For more on this story, go to the link in bio and follow me @estherhorvath.
