Photo by @acacia.johnson | A pair of airplanes flies in formation over a frozen lake near Knik Glacier, Alaska. Since only 20% of Alaska is accessible by road, small aircraft equipped to land on natural features—such as tundra, beaches, water, ice, and snow—are part of Alaska's infrastructure and culture. The state has six times more pilots per capita than anywhere else in the United States, with over 9,000 registered pilots flying in more than 2 million square miles of airspace.
