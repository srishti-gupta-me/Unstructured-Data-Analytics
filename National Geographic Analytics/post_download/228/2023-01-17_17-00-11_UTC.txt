Photo by @brianskerry | A sea turtle is ensnared in discarded fishing net that was drifting in the waters off Sri Lanka. After making this photograph, my team and I freed the turtle, and it strongly and quickly swam away. Mortality from entanglement in plastic, such as discarded fishing gear, has increased substantially over the past century for sea turtles, marine mammals, and birds. #SeaTurtles #OceanPlastic
