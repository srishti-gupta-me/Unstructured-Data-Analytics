Photo by @joelsartore | Ever wonder how a lemur like this Von der Decken’s sifaka got its name? Local Malagasy people named it for its unique call, which echoes through Madagascar's forests and sounds like shif-auk. As herbivores, these primates spend their days foraging for flowers, leaves, fruit, and tree bark, and are known to consume nearly 100 plant species. They need the forest to survive, and the forests of Madagascar in turn depend on lemurs to help maintain the health and reproduction of many tree species. This is no easy feat. Forests within their range are already highly fragmented—cut down for charcoal production, then burned to provide pasture for livestock. Photo taken at Madagascar's Lemuria Land.
