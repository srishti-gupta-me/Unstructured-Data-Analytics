Photo by @jasperdoest | We know kissing as a greeting and as a way of expressing love, desire, and respect. But what about monkeys? Do they also kiss? 

Yes. Some species, such as macaques and baboons, will often make communication gestures known as lip-smacking, which can lead to contact with the lips. It usually occurs between adult female monkeys and their young infants. 

Aside from kissing, monkeys will hug and groom each other. Grooming is a way to show affection and respect. It helps to reduce tension by lowering the heart rate and releasing endorphins, the "feel-good" hormones.
