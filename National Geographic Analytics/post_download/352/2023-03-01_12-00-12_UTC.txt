Photo by @katieorlinsky | I captured the northern lights, also known as aurora borealis, on a February night in Canada's Yukon Territory in 2014. This incredible yet common phenomenon takes place near the magnetic poles, the result of collisions between electrically charged particles from the sun that enter Earth's atmosphere. It was the first time I saw the lights. Since then I've continued to work in the Arctic, but I still remember this night as the most spectacular display I've seen.
