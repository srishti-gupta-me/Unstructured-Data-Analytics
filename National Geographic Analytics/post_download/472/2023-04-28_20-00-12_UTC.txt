Noor Jehan, 17, the zoo's other elephant, died on Saturday after a fall in a pond inside her enclosure. Volunteers and doctors poured in from all over Pakistan and abroad, dedicating themselves to improving her prognosis. She was unable to stand and eventually succumbed to complications from lying down for so long, a life-threatening situation for elephants. I walked through the zoo last February, witnessing with a heavy heart the state of the animals there. Following this tragedy, authorities are now considering closing the zoo and moving Madhubula to a more appropriate place to give her a chance at a better life. Elephants, which normally can live for decades, are known to have much shorter life spans in captivity. For more insights into our world, follow @paleyphoto.
