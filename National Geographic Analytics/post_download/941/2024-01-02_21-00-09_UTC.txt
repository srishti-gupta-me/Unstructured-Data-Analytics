Photo by Mattias Klum @mattiasklumofficial | A red-billed oxpecker looks for parasites on an impala in Nyerere National Park, Tanzania. These birds can eat hundreds of ticks a day. Although they rid animals of pests, oxpeckers are considered parasites themselves, as their preferred food is blood. While they search for bloated ticks, they also feed on blood directly, pecking at an animalâ€™s wounds to keep them open. Follow @mattiasklumofficial to see more images of wildlife.
