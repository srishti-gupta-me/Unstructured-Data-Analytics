Photo by @brianskerry | Orcas swim through a fjord days before the polar night in the Norwegian Arctic. (A polar night is a winter phenomenon typical of the polar circles when the sun doesnâ€™t rise above the horizon for 24 hours or more, sometimes for months.) In the fall, orcas often move into these fjords, following the migrations of herring from offshore. Throughout the darkness of winter, the orcas will feed on herring, using complex dialects to communicate.
