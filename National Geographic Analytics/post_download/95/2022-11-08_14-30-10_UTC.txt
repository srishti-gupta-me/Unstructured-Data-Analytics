Photo by Corey Arnold @arni_coraldo | San Francisco was the focus of the raccoon portion of my article on urban wildlife, but on most nights during my quest, a coyote seemed to show up and steal the show. This coyote is letting out a defensive warningâ€”a howl toward the presence of a pre-dawn dog walker nearby. Coyotes often feast on rodents and other natural foods found in parks, empty lots, and overgrown green spaces. But there are conflicting opinions about whether coyotes should be allowed to populate dense urban spaces. Pets such as cats and small dogs have increasingly been targeted as the coyotes expand across the San Francisco Bay Area. Check out the story by writer @christinedellamore and me in the July issue or in the link in bio. #urbanwildlife #coyote #howl #carnivore
