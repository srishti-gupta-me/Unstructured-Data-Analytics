Photo by @chrisburkard | What does it take to surf in the Aleutian Islands? Months—even years—of planning. Countless late nights pouring over maps and swell charts trying to forecast waves that we'd only heard about from rumors. The extreme weather coming off the Bering Sea kept us slightly nervous as we waited for our window to fly in, hoping to catch the swell of a lifetime. The conditions lined up, the sky opened, and we couldn't believe the intersection of remote, snowy volcanoes and a perfect swell … truly an unforgettable experience.
