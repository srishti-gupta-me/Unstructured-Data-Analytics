Photo by @newshatavakolian | I made this image of what I imagined could be an album cover for an Iranian female singer in Tehran. (The subject herself isn't a singer but represents the idea.)

It was part of a project I call Listen, photographed in 2010-2011, which focused on Iran's women singers—who are not allowed to perform solo or produce their own CDs due to Islamic regulations in effect since the 1979 revolution.

For the other photos I made in the series, I captured six individual professional singers, performing as if they were in front of a large audience—in reality it was in a small private studio in downtown Tehran. Then I made a dream CD cover for each of the women, my own interpretation of the society I live in and experience. #Iran
