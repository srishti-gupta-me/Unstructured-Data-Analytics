Photo by @timlaman | A female Pennant's red colobus in early morning light. This critically endangered species is endemic to Bioko island, in Equatorial Guinea. I photographed the monkey and many others on a RAVE, a Rapid Assessment Visual Expedition, for National Geographic. Follow me @timlaman for more wildlife and bird photographs. #wildlifephotography #conservation #wildlife #BiokoIsland
