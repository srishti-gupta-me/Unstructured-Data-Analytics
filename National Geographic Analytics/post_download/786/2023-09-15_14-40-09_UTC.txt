Photo by Mattias Klum @mattiasklumofficial | After many weeks and quite a logistical nightmare, I managed to photograph this charming female kinkajou in the rainforest canopy in Panama for @natgeo. Kinkajous are not super rare but are very hard to find and photograph. This one is holding onto a balsa flower filled with nectar mixed with rainwater. Silently and hardly moving so as not to frighten off the animals, Lars-Magnus Ejdeholm, my amazing assistant at the time, and I looked for them with our night-vision binoculars. If they showed up, we would be ready with cameras and large flash systems. Lars-Magnus sat in the fork of one branch, and I sat in another, both of us secured with climbing ropes. Kinkajous are sensitive to sound and movement, so we had to be up in the trees several hours before sunset. Some nights the animals turned up, other nights it was silent and dark and the assignment felt pretty hopeless. It was difficult to get any closer to the animals. But after a few weeks it seemed that they were becoming habituated to our presence. Certain animals got used to the camera flash and the weak light from Lars-Magnus’s flashlight. They came closer and stayed longer. On a couple of occasions, everything fell into place. The shy kinkajous finally dared to drink nectar just an arm’s length from the camera.
