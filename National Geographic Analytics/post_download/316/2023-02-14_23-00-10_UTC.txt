Photo by @javier_aznar_photography | A male sun glass frog (Hyalinobatrachium aureoguttatum) stands guard over a heart-shaped egg clutch in the Ecuadorian Choc√≥ rainforest. This father will kick out any animal trying to prey on its offspring, and gather dew from leaves to keep the eggs hydrated until they hatch into tadpoles. As with many other glass frog species, dads help their young reach the next habitat: the water, where the tadpoles will spend some time before returning to the forest.
