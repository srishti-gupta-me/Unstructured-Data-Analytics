Photo by @tasneemalsultan | During a festival in Ha'il, a city in northwestern Saudi Arabia, Um Ahmed was selling coffee and tea to visitors. After hearing her story, I decided to include her in my ongoing series, Saudi Tales of Love. As I travel across the country, I'm always looking to find stories of women and their relationship to love, marriage, and loss. She was married at 15. It was a loveless marriage and she disliked her husband. “I found him a second wife who was more suited to him," she told me. "And knew he would later divorce me and let me raise my children alone. He followed my plan." She's now in her 60s and describes as herself as the "happiest mother of educated, successful children.”
