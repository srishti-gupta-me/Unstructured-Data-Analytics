Photo by Robbie Shone @shonephoto | In 2013, when I first visited this spot in the Schwarzmooskogel ice cave, the rocks and boulders were almost completely buried by ice. Today much of it has melted, exposing the rocks. In the background, the impressive snow cone for which this hall is named is also shrinking. It’s a sad sight to see. In the article "When the Magic Melts," in the October issue, I document the contributions of scientists—and tour guides—as they work against the clock in this rapidly disappearing landscape.
