Photo by Charlie Hamilton James @chamiltonjames | Maasai herdsmen discuss lions as a storm brews behind them. During the period in which this image was shot, lion predation on cattle in the area around the village of Talek, on the edge of Kenya's Masai Mara Reserve, was high. The Maasai had been grazing their cattle inside the reserve in day and night shifts, bringing them into regular contact with the local lions. The result was a strange relationship: the lions developed strategies to hunt the cattle, mainly at night, and the Maasai learned to avoid them by texting each other the locations of the lions. It was exhilarating and terrifying to photograph—on foot—at night, and I was amazed by the bravery of the guys, who would run right up to the lions, throwing stones to scare them off. The lions would usually stand their ground, growling aggressively, and although they do occasionally attack, I never witnessed it.
