Photo by @estherhorvath | This view from Tenoren ("Tenor") peak of Operafjellet ("Opera") mountain in Norway's Svalbard archipelago shows the last rays of the sun before it disappears for months. On October 26, the sun will dip below the horizon and soon the polar night, with its 24 hours of darkness, will begin. The sun will return to the archipelago around February 15, when it'll be possible to climb the mountains for views like this again. Follow me @estherhorvath for more polar stories.
