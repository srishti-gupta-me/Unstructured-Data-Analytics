Photo by @beverlyjoubert | There’s nothing like a bird's-eye view of a herd on the move. It provides a sense of scale and perspective that’s impossible to achieve from the ground. Charging across the vast expanse of Botswana’s Selinda Reserve, one of the most pristine wilderness areas left on our planet, the buffalo were a sight to behold: hundreds of animals moving as one, hooves kicking up dust into the air. Faced with awe-inspiring sights like this one, it's easy to appreciate the complexity of the ecosystem that supports these immense animals—and the importance of protecting it.
