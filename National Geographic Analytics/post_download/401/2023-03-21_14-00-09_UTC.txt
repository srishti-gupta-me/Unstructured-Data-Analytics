Photo by Orsolya Haarberg @fjellheimengalleri | Iceland in a nutshell: volcano, ice, sea stack, basalt rocks, and the northern lights. All these elements combine in a single image at Lóndrangar. Below the Snæfellsjökull ice cap (background), a 700,000-year-old volcano sleeps. It last erupted about 1,800 years ago. Follow @fjellheimengalleri for more images.
