Photo by @hannahreyesmorales | This portrait of Marta and Apolinar is one of my favoritesâ€”and it reminds me of the healing power of love. They're seated on their bed, which is covered by mosquito netting. For Marta, an assault survivor, Apolinar's support was part of her healing process at a time when there was no support structure for victims. She was assaulted in a mass rape during World War II. 

For situations like this, the question I ask myself is, how I can portray the complexity that comes with survival and healing without playing down the severity of the trauma we carry. Follow me @hannahreyesmorales for more stories from the Philippines and beyond. #ValentinesDay
