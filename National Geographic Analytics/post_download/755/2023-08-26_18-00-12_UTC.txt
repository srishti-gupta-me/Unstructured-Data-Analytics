Photo by @amivitale | Rimland Lemojong, a Samburu elephant keeper, sits with Kinya, a two-week-old elephant that was orphaned after falling into a water well in northern Kenya. A team from the Reteti Elephant Sanctuary waited close to 36 hours for her mother to return. She never came back, so the team rushed the infant to the sanctuary to care for her. Reteti is Africa's first community-owned elephant sanctuary, where orphans learn to be wild so that one day they can rejoin their herds.
