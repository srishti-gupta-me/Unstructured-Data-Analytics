Photo by @timlaman | Today’s surprise in the Borneo rainforest is viper love. A male Bornean green pit viper (Tropidolaemus subannulatus) snuggles on the much larger female (they're actually the same species), which I can only assume is a courtship behavior. There’s always something new to see every day in the forest. I’m on assignment in Gunung Palung National Park, West Kalimantan, Indonesia, documenting the biodiversity of this key refuge. Tune in @TimLaman for more from the field. #viper #snake #borneo #indonesia #gunungpalungnationalpark
