Photo by Jennifer Hayes @jenniferhayesig | Dense coral gardens surround Kennedy Island in the Solomon Islands. In the early hours of August 2, 1945, Lieutenant John F. Kennedy and his crew were patrolling Blackett Strait when their boat, PT 109, was struck by the Japanese destroyer Amagiri. The attack ripped away part of PT 109, killing two crewmen but leaving enough floating wreckage for survivors to cling to throughout the moonless night. Kennedy, a powerful swimmer, led his men to cover on what was then known as Plum Pudding Island; they rested and hid there until their journey to Olasana Island and eventually their rescue, with the help of local coastwatchers. The island, since renamed to honor the young lieutenant who would later become a U.S. president, is visited by many. It is wonderful to see the corals expand and flourish around this small island steeped in World War II history. For more ocean stories, follow @jenniferhayesig.
