Photo by @moisessaman | At a quarry in Pissy, on the western edge of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, men, women, and children—some younger than 10—extract granite that will be broken down to make concrete and gravel for house construction, exemplifying a move away from traditional building materials. The extraction process involves burning tires in order to create the heat necessary to crack massive slabs of granite, which are then broken down into ever smaller pieces and carried in large loads on the workers' heads up the quarry’s steep slopes. Quarry workers estimate that they burn at least 200 tires a day. The noxious fumes from the tires along with the extreme heat create hazardous working conditions for those who labor there for up to 14 hours a day. Although there are several mechanized quarries around Ouagadougou that have undercut prices, the quarry at Pissy persists because of the insatiable demand for new concrete housing.
