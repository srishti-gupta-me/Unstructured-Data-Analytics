Photo by @jasperdoest | Yusuf, 14, finds solace in the company of a sparrow, a moment of joy in his otherwise difficult life as a Syrian refugee in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq. His family fled Syria in 2012, and Yusuf has spent most of his life within the camp there. Four years ago he found a passion for breeding and raising pigeons, which gives him a small sense of normalcy amid the turmoil. “I love them,” he says. ”They take care of their offspring, and I take care of them. I give them water and food. They are part of my life.” Follow me @jasperdoest for more on the relationship between humankind and nature. #compassion #humananimalbond
