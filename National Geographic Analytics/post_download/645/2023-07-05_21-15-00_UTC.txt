Photo by @kiliiiyuyan | One of the things most people don’t know about me is that I love swing dancing and the exuberance of it all. Recently, I had the chance to go swing dancing at Sagebrush, a honky-tonk in Austin, Texas, with a welcome-all vibe. Folks were dressed to impress—cowboys boots and all—and spent the evening swing dancing, two-stepping, and more to live music from singer-songwriter Summer Dean. To capture the joyful energy of the place, I made a series of long exposures that resulted in the whirling of dancers around locals Billy Baca and Jace Romero. Baca is a well-known local tattoo artist who loves to two-step and embodies the city’s colorful, careening soul. | From outdoor adventures to big-city skylines, there are a million different trips to @traveltex, but the only one that matters is yours.
