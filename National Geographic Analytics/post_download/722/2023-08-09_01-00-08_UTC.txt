Having a glass of wine or other "nightcap" before bed has long been thought of as a way to help someone sleep, but a look at the evidence suggests otherwise. Even a small amount of alcohol can make sleep worse by elevating your heart rate and interfering with REM sleep, for example. Drinking alcohol is also linked to a higher risk of sleep apnea, in general, and to more severe snoring and obstructive sleep apnea in those who already have these health problems.
