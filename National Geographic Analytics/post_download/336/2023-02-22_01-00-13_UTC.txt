Alaska's sled dog racing season is currently in full swing; it's a tradition with over 3,000 years of history in the Arctic Circle. Indigenous communities there used sled dogs long before Europeans bred the animals for transportation and hauling as they colonized the region in the 19th century. It wasnâ€™t until the 1960s, when highways were built and snowmobiles became widespread, that dogs were no longer needed for transport. Still, the practice of mushing, as traveling by sled dog is known, remained a cultural and recreational activity in communities across the Arctic, and the world of competitive racing began.
