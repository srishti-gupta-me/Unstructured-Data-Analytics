Photo by David Guttenfelder @dguttenfelder | To slow Don Lueck’s dementia, his doctors suggested that he learn a new skill. He took up art in 2019 and has made more than 17,000 paintings. The hobby helped the gregarious 77-year-old endure pandemic-imposed isolation in his Madison, Wisconsin home. “Painting every day during this time saved our lives because his brain was actively engaged in a creative process he loves,” says his wife, Jenny Villwock. “He often includes faces or creatures in his painting—someone with whom he could socialize.” This portrait of Lueck, surrounded by some of his paintings, is part of the January 2023 cover story, “Living Longer—and Better: How Science Could Change the Way We Age.”
