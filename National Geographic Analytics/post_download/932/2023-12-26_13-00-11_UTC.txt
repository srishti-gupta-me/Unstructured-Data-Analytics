Photo by @amivitale | In 2017 a tiny five-month-old elephant named Nadasoit captured hearts at Kenya's Reteti Elephant Sanctuary. Rescued from a hand-dug well at the tender age of two weeks, she was airlifted to Reteti due to pneumonia. Under the nurturing care of Shaba, a surrogate matriarch and fellow orphan, Nadasoit found a protector and mentor. Over time, she absorbed Shaba's wisdom, displaying remarkable traits and a nurturing spirit. Nadasoit formed a deep bond with another orphan, Loisaba, and their playful antics and intertwining trunks showcased their affection for each other. After three years of devoted care at Reteti, Nadasoit, Loisaba, and another orphan named Bawa were successfully reintroduced to the wild. Follow @amivitale for updates on the sanctuary.
