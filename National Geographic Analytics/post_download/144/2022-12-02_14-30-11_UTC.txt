Before young calves grow to reach the title of world’s tallest animal, they are vulnerable to a range threats, and in predator-dense areas, up to 50 percent of them are likely to fall to a hungry lion or hyena. To give them time to grow and develop in preparation for entry into a dangerous world, mother giraffes carry their young in the womb for 15 months. After that, the mothers’ expert ability to hide their young and defensive kicks when danger draws near help nudge the odds of survival upward. #giraffe #giraffecalf #wildlife
