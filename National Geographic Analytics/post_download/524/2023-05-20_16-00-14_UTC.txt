Photo by @tasneemalsultan | Ahmed, a Luxor farmer, sustains his crops through the annual flooding of the Nile River, brought on by the rainy season in upstream Ethiopia and Sudan. The floods carry nutrient-rich sediment that for 5,000 years has nourished fertile lands and sustained Egyptians. Dams now better control the floods in high-water years but also interrupt the river's natural cycle.
