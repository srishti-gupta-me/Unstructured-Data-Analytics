The aim is to attract a female with an often intricate display, demonstrating its prowess—a strategy some bird species use as part of their sexual selection. Male cock-of-the-rock display on low branches, with exaggerated head and neck movements and a strange call, often to each other, as they wait for a female to turn up and show interest.
