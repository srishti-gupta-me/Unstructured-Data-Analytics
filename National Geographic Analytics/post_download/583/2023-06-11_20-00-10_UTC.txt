Photo by @jasperdoest | King penguins are one of the two species of penguins that inhabit the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. They are known for their distinctive orange ear patches and bright yellow and orange coloring on their necks and chests. Using a long shutter speed, I captured this scene of densely packed individuals walking side by side, in an attempt to showcase the remarkable abundance of wildlife for which South Georgia is renowned. 

South Georgia's unique environmental conditions make it a prime breeding location for king penguins, drawing in thousands of pairs annually. The waters around the island teem with krill and small fish, essential food sources for the penguins and their chicks. Follow @jasperdoest for more images of the wonders of nature
