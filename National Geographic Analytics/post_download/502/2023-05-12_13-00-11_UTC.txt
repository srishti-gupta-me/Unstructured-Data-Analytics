Photo by @noralorek | Betty Yangi learned to embroider milayas, or bed linens, as a young girl in South Sudan. Fleeing the civil war, she lives in a Ugandan refugee camp with her two children and her mother. To feed her family, she works with the @milayaproject, a nonprofit that emerged out of a National Geographic article I photographed with writer @ninastrochlic. The Milaya Project works with women who make the ornate bedsheets. For decades, war in South Sudan has forced refugees to go back and forth between their home and neighboring Uganda. Bidibidi, with more than 250,000 people, is now one of the worlds largest refugee settlements. For more on life there, go to the link in bio.
