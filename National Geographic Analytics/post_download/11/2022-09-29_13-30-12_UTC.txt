The world spins around you, holding back any calmness that you might have. Out here, along Botswana's Chobe River, I have the space and quiet to assess why I do what I do. What does the world outside know or understand about issues that don’t affect them on a daily basis? We are so connected now that each and every one of us can have a profound influence on the planet. Sometimes it's as if I'm standing within my world as those around me spin—until they stop and pay attention rather than accelerating past it. To see more, follow me @chancellordavid.
