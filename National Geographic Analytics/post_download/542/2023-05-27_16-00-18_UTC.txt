Photo by Reuben Wu @reuben | A Perseid meteor burns in a bright streak as it enters the Earth's atmosphere above Lake Michigan. Every year around mid-August, the Perseid meteor shower puts on a spectacular show for stargazers across the globe, a phenomenon caused by Earth passing through debris left behind by the Swift-Tuttle comet. In its peak years, the number of meteors seen can reach 200 an hour. I captured this single exposure during an all-night time lapse on August 11, 2016, near Muskegon, Michigan.
