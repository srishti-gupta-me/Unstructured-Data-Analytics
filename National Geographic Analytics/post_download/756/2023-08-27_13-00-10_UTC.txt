Photo by @iantehphotography | I love this vibrant scene of subantarctic moorland and Magellanic beech trees set against the sea, their gnarly, bare branches sculpted by the constant furious winds. I took this photo on my last day on Hornos Island, at the tip of South America. The expedition team and I had endured climatic mood swings, from icy gales and rain to brilliant sunshine—often in 20-minute cycles. The team was exhausted, hungry, and jubilant. We had, after all, found the world’s southernmost tree.

I decided to explore the scenery we had trudged past in previous days as I followed the team on its primary mission. Now with the relief that we had accomplished what we had set out to do, I felt free to hunt for other creative possibilities. Some of the landscape on Cape Horn reminds me of Cornwall in England, except brighter and more saturated with color. You’d expect a pleasant stroll through these technicolor meadows, but the trees are sometimes hidden in creeks, making the ground appear flat until it’s too late. As I enjoyed the last moments of walking toward the lighthouse to catch my ride home, I plunged into the ground. My arms splayed, a gesture of surprise that saved me from dropping any further through the brush-camouflaged aperture and into the running water below my dangling feet. Grabbing at the surrounding vegetation, I crawled out gingerly. Half an hour later, with the island’s parting gift to me in my camera, I was relieved, grateful, and happy in a Zodiac riding out with the last of the team to our wooden boat, the Oveja Negra.
