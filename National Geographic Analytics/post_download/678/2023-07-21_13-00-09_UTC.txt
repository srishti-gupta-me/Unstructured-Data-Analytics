Photo by @jenguyton | In the heart of Costa Rica, I found myself traversing the emerald realm of Monteverde on a National Geographic expedition. A spectral creature emerged from the fog-shrouded foliage: the elusive, resplendent quetzal, an avatar of freedom in Maya and Aztec lore, its dazzling plumage a symbol of wealth and divinity. For a moment, the male struck a pose as we balanced precariously on a hanging bridge. In the mating season, males grow twin tail streamers up to three feet long. After I took this photo, he all but disappeared—the tips of his feathers still poking out—into his nest hole inside a hollow tree, where the males and females take turns incubating the eggs. Sadly, the continued existence of these beautiful birds is in jeopardy, as deforestation ravages their habitat. @natgeoexpeditions
