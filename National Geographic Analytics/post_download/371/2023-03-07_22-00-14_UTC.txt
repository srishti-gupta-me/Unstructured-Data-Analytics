Photo by @tasneemalsultan | With the recent earthquakes, my thoughts turned again to the plight of Syrian refugees and how these events exacerbate their tenuous situation. This photo of a Syrian refugee was taken in Amman, Jordan, in 2016.

"I've stopped going to school for a few months now. I want to keep attending but the boys here harass me, asking me to sell myself since I'm a Syrian girl. They keep saying that pretty Syrian girls get a lot of money." I was walking with the 14-year-old through a graveyard. "We were never harassed back home," she continued. "But Syria is gone." 

I saw so much devastation in the young eyes of these beautiful souls. I had never witnessed such love for a nation or land. A 10- year-old wrote a poem, a 15-year-old made a collage, and a 7-year-old created a photo essay, all focused on the loss of their beloved Syria, a place now further traumatized and forgotten. 

Was Syria ideal? Or do we miss only what we can't ever get back? As we exchanged hugs and tears, I realized the strongest souls are the ones that keep smiling. She adds: "It's not being in denial; being positive is a must."
