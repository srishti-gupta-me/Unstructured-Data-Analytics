Photo by @brianfinke | I started documenting New York City "bike life" in the summer of 2020, and though the sport is almost year-round, I found that the long days and hot light of summer complement bike life's spirit of freedom and play and exploration.
 
In this image, bikers Emmanuel De La Rosa and Albert Acosta surf on their bikes while riding over the RFK Bridge. You can’t see it here, but there are no rails at that point of the bridge—and we were very high up.
 
Bike life is a community that borders on a movement: artistic, social, and expressive. The scene is composed predominantly of young adults and teens from diverse backgrounds and genders from all around the city who, through bike tricks—wheelies, swerving, dancing, and surfing—express a sort of creative language and personal style.
 
Gatherings happen regularly as "rideouts," where from 10 to 1,500 bikers ride en masse, weaving through the city for 10 to 35 miles, all while mesmerizing bystanders with a parade of stunts and choreographed and freestyle compositions. Bike life’s circulating message—“We’re outside”—speaks to a certain vibe of freedom and positivity, staying true, and celebrating and lifting up one another's individual styles, not only on the bike but also in the world, in being.
