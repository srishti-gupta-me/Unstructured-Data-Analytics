Photo by @spencerlowell_ | The Allen Telescope Array in Hat Creek, California, is an assembly of 42 individual 6-meter parabolic dishes that collectively operate as a singular radio telescope. In this image, Jon Richards, a senior software engineer for SETI (the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute), is servicing one of the antenna dishes. This unique design enables the ATA to simultaneously scan broad portions of the sky across a wide frequency range of 1 to 10 GHz, making it a pivotal SETI instrument. By detecting potential signals from advanced extraterrestrial civilizations, collaborating with global telescopes, and adapting flexibly to different observation needs, the ATA stands as a cornerstone in humanity's quest to uncover signs of life beyond Earth. #WorldSpaceWeek
