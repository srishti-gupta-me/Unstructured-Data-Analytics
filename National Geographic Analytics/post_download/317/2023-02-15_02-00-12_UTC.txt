Photo by @kiliiiyuyan | Mikhail Bahe feeds her baby on a traditional Navajo cradleboard, or awéétsʼáál, in her family’s modern hogan on the Navajo Nation in Arizona. Traditional Diné parents like Mikhail use cradleboards to keep their babies safe until they are ready to crawl—a technology that's evolved over thousands of years of parental love. Follow me, @kiliiiyuyan, for more from the worlds of Indigenous communities, and stay tuned more images of love as National Geographic celebrates #ValentinesDay.
