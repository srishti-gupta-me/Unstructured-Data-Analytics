Photo by @lucalocatelliphoto | Off the coast of Italy, Nemoâ€™s Garden is composed of six biospheres that make for a lunar, almost alien scene. It's an experiment to test whether  underwater greenhouses could be an agricultural option for arid coastal countries that must put resources into desalinating water for crops. 

Each dome has a platform that allows divers to partially enter the shell (as seen in the foreground). Plant cultivation is based on the hydroponic technique, whereby soil is replaced by a substrate that contains the nutrients and minerals needed for plant growth. As sunlight penetrates the humid domes, it leads to further condensation, generating the water source for the plants. Since no pests can penetrate the environment, it also doesn't require the use of chemical pesticides.
