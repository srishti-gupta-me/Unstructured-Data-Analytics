Photo by @macstonephoto | No, this isn't the moon. Insects, fungus, and bacteria play a role in breaking down organic material in the swamp. Anaerobic bacteria living in the water column and soil feed on minerals like sulphur, copper, and iron. The byproduct of breaking down these minerals can create a rainbow sheen or oil-like slick on the water surface. Sometimes these are mistaken for petroleum spills, but you can tell the difference: If disturbed, those from bacteria will break off into platelets and will not reform with one another. After sunset, while slogging through Beidler Forest in South Carolina, I saw this pattern on the water's surface. I aimed the camera at the reflections of trees and the oily sheen, resulting in an image that appears to be a moon rising over the swamp.
