Photo by @amivitale | Lekupania is a Samburu animal whisperer, who cares for a host of species like elephants, gerenuks, kudo, warthogs, and so many more. Here, he reaches up to feed two orphaned giraffes in his care at the Reteti Elephant Sanctuary (@r.e.s.c.u.e). While known for its work with elephants, @r.e.s.c.u.e also helps care for other animals. I'm celebrating Reteti's 6th anniversary with Lekupania and the rest of the team this month.
