Photo by @simonnorfolkstudio | A heart in nature is seen at the Kronotsky Nature Reserve, a biosphere in the far east of Russia, on the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Now a World Heritage site, it was established in 1934 and covers more than 4,000 square miles (over 10,000 square kilometers). Kronotsky holds Russia's only geyser basin, in addition to mountain ranges with active and extinct volcanoes. The reserve, subject to bitter winters, is accessible only to scientists and a limited number of tourists. #ValentinesDay
