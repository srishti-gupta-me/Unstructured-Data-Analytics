Photo by @joelsartore | The tawny frogmouth may be small, but this bird is full of personality. Categorized as a “false owl” because of its owl-like body and froglike mouth, this bird, found throughout Australia, has a look like no other. During the day, they sleep in the trees, perfectly positioning their bodies to mimic branches, which provides protection from predators. When the sun goes down, the tawny frogmouths come to life, hunting everything from nocturnal insects to small mammals, reptiles, frogs, and other birds. Most of the bird’s prey is obtained by pouncing to the ground from an elevated perch while some prey items, such as moths, are caught in flight. Photo taken @fortworthzoo.
