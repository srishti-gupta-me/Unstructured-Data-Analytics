Photo by @joelsartore. | A critically endangered northern white-cheeked gibbon holds her baby @gibbonconservationcenter in California. Dedicated exclusively to helping gibbons both in human care and in the wild, this center plays a vital role in saving these small apes from extinction, but it has just lost its lease and needs our help now. To learn how you can save the gibbon center, follow me @joelsartore for details. #GibbonConservationCenter #PhotoArk #SaveTogether
