Photo by @paoloverzone | I photographed this mummy, KV21B, while it was being transported from a storage room at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo for DNA sampling and a CT scan to determine its family tree. The mummy was found in the KV21 tomb in Egyptâ€™s Valley of the Kings, which was discovered by the Italian explorer Giovanni Battista Belzoni in 1817 and later re-excavated by the American archaeologist Donald P. Ryan in the 1980s. The tomb contained another mummy, KV21A, and both are believed to be 18th dynasty queens. Follow @paoloverzone for more images and stories.
