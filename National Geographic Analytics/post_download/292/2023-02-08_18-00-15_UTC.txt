Photo by @jenniferhayesig | A mother harp seal coaxes her pup into the water for a swimming lesson with a calming nose-to-nose kiss of recognition: I am your mother; you are my pup. She then guided the pup through icy water for several minutes until she detected several aggressive males circling below. Each February, harp seals are born on the sea ice in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in eastern Canada, and their mothers will nurse them for 12 to 15 days before she leaves to mate and migrate north to the Arctic. To survive, the pup relies on fat reserves and a few weeks of stable ice until it learns to swim and forage for food. This image is part of a series celebrating love on #ValentinesDay.
