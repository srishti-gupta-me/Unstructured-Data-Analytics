Photo by @joelsartore | The mohol bush baby is a tiny, nocturnal primate from southern Africa. Most often found occupying wooded areas, family groups of two to seven bush babies will frequently spend the day nestled together in a tree hollow, but will split up at night to look for food. When apart from one another, bush babies communicate with loud soundsâ€”an alarm call can result in several individuals ganging up on a potential predator.
