Photo by @javier_aznar_photography | A treehopper (Cyphonia sp.) feeds on the sap of a plant in the Ecuadorian rainforest, its back covered by hairs that make it look like a rock star. Though their function remains unknown, the tiny hairs can help camouflage the insects in the trees they inhabit. The hairs may also be sensitive, capable of receiving unknown stimuli possibly to sense the surroundings. Treehoppers haven’t been studied as closely as their relatives, the leafhopper or cicada, which has led to significant gaps in our knowledge of these bugs. If you want to read more about these little creatures and their many disguises, check out my story “Inside the world of treehoppers, mini-marvels of the rainforest” in the link in bio.
