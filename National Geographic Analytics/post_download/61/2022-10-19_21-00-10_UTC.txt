Photo by @joelsartore | Found on every continent except Antarctica and South America, moles like this eastern mole @newildliferehab in Nebraska are often seen as garden pests because of their intricate underground tunnel systems. While their tunneling behavior may label moles as a backyard nuisance, they actually play a beneficial role in soil management and controlling the population of undesirable grubs and insects. By moving earth, moles facilitate better aeration of the soil and enable organic matter to travel deeper. Their tunneling also allows subsoil material to be moved closer to the surface, where nutrients may be more available to plant roots.
