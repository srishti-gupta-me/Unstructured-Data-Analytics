However, the harmful toxic gases remained, and the researchers had to wear masks. Time was tight, and it was still a matter of urgency as temperatures rose to 50°C (120°F) in the deeper parts. Microbiologist Martina Cappelletti and speleologist Bogdan Onac take samples of microorganisms before sending them straight down to the base camp tent, just off the lava field, and analyzed. Their research goal is to find traces of microbial colonization within these new lava tube structures.
