Photo by @jasperdoest | An Anatolian leopard, an endangered species native to the Iranian plateau whose territory spans more than 40 square kilometers (15 sq mi), now inhabits a small zoo enclosure in Duhok, Iraq. This animal, with an estimated wild population of only a thousand, lost one of its hind legs after getting caught in a wolf trap placed by mountain shepherds trying to protect their herds.

Despite the IUCN’s recommendation that the leopard be relocated to a larger facility in Europe as part of a breeding program, the government has deemed it the property of Iraq, and the animal has been unable to receive the resources it needs for full rehabilitation. The leopard’s growl of distress speaks volumes—a heartbreaking reminder of the consequences of human intervention and the urgent need to protect the dwindling population of threatened species.
