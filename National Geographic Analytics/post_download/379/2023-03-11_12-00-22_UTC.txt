Photo by @rubensalgadoescudero | Faustina Flores Carranza, 68, and Juan Astudillo Jesus, 65, sit in their solar-lit home in San Luis Acatlán, a town in Guerrero, Mexico. The couple of 50 years have seven children. Like many members of the Mextica Indigenous community, they live in rural areas outside the reach of electric grids. When I asked how solar has made a difference in their lives, Faustina answered, “For the first time, we are able to look at each other in the eyes in our moments of intimacy.” This photograph is part of Solar Portraits, a long-term project that addresses the lack of electricity access around the world and the positive impact that solar electricity systems are having in different communities.
