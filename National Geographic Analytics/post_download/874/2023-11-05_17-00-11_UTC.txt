Photo by @michaelgeorge | A dog stands on the edge of the Earth. Well, let me clarify. The dog is on the cliff’s edge at Cape Finisterre in Spain's Galicia region—which in Roman times was believed to be the end of the Earth, or at least the known world. Pilgrims who walk the Camino de Santiago will often continue their journey to this point, the true end of the road. In 2013, after walking my own pilgrimage, I did just that. As the sun set, a stray dog from town wandered out on the rocks as if it was looking to enjoy the view as well. My fellow travelers and I nicknamed him Perrogrino, a play on the Spanish words “perro” (dog) and “peregrino” (pilgrim).
