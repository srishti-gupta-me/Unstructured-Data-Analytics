This is from a series I titled the Glass House, after I overheard a local refer to the city by that name. He meant that although the capital was somewhat secure with the presence of the American military and its NATO allies, there was still a risk of instability as the country was at war. Indeed, during the summer elections, there were attacks such as car bombs exploding in front of embassies and other public spaces on several occasions. In 2021, after two decades at war with America, the Taliban resumed power. The  future of the country hangs in the balance, with 70% of the populace under 25 years of age.
