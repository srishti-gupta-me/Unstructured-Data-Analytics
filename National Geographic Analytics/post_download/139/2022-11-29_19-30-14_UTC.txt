Photo by @beverlyjoubert | What a catch! With so many dramatic predator-prey battles playing out across the sprawling landscapes of Botswana’s Okavango Delta, hunters of the winged kind can be easily overlooked. But cast your eyes (and camera) skyward and you’ll soon appreciate why they shouldn’t be. No shortage of skill, agility, and precision was spent to acquire this prized frog meal. Colorful beauty aside, the woodland kingfisher is a sight to behold as it swoops down on unsuspecting prey. #birdlovers #kingfisher #birdwatchers
