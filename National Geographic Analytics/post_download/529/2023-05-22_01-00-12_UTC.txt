Photos by @paoloverzone | A hundred years ago the discovery of Tutankhamun’s tomb in the Valley of the Kings in Luxor, Egypt, revolutionized the world of archaeology and inspired a wave of Egyptomania that still resonates. The tomb is famous for its extraordinary wealth of artifacts and treasures, including his golden mask, considered one of the most beautiful pieces of ancient Egypt. The burial chamber is decorated with paintings that depict scenes from ancient Egyptian mythology. His mummy is still inside the tomb, where it was buried more than 3,000 years ago. The tomb itself is relatively tiny compared to others in the Valley of the Kings, but even after a century, its sacred aura and mystery remain intact. Today, with generations of Egyptian archaeologists looking after the boy king’s grave, Egyptology is entering a new era. Read more about the discovery of Tut’s tomb at the link in bio.
