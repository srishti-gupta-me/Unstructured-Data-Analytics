Photo by Aaron Huey @argonautphoto | A lone palm tree stands charred after the 2008 Freeway Complex fire, which destroyed 314 residences in Anaheim Hills and Yorba Linda, California. It was just one of the many unprecedented wildfires in the state during a period of accelerating climate change, red-flag days, and extreme weather in all forms. This week leaders in the state named those they believe to be driving these conditions in a lawsuit: the five biggest oil companies in the world. The suit alleges that the companies deceived the public for the past 50 years about the deadly impact of fossil fuels on our planet and the resulting damage that has cost California taxpayers billions of dollars in health and environmental tolls. While an uneventful California wildfire season this year was a welcome respite, record-breaking rainfall and floods made headlines instead. The decades ahead look to be filled with more extreme phenomena. For an ongoing series on the climate crisis, please visit me @argonautphoto.
