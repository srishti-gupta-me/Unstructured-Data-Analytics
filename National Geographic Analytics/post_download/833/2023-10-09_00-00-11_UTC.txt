Photo by @spencerlowell_ | When I learned of the space shuttle Endeavour's journey in 2012 through Los Angeles from LAX to the California Science Center, I was instantly inspired to create this image. I researched the route of the shuttle, selected the ideal day, and chartered a helicopter. To achieve the most parallel view, I stood on the struts of the helicopter as it banked. As a photographer with a love of science, this image resonates deeply with me, juxtaposing humanity's terrestrial existence with our cosmic aspirations. #WorldSpaceWeek
