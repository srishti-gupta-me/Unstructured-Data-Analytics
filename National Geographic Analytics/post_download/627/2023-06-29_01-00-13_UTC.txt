Photo by @amivitale | Philip, a Samburu guide, greets a reticulated giraffe in the Namunyak Wildlife Conservancy in northern Kenya. The community here has been deeply involved in preserving the diversity of its wildlife. The conservancy helps the Samburu combine their knowledge with modern science to more sustainably manage their rangeland. Across Africa, giraffe populations dropped nearly 40 percent over three decades, and the reticulated giraffe, one of the four species, numbers fewer than 16,000. While the decline is thought to be caused by habitat loss and poaching, including animals killed by snares, scientists are now pursuing major studies to understand why giraffes are disappearing and what can be done about it. It will take strong partnerships among local community members like Philip, scientists, and all of us. @sararafoundation @r.e.s.c.u.e
