Photo by Robbie Shone @shonephoto | Slovenia has many wonders, but for me the most iconic are its river caves. Pictured here is Križna, named after the nearby church of St. Cross (Sv. Križa). The cave features a chain of underground lakes with emerald green water. It's one of the few touristed caves in Slovenia that doesn't contain concrete pathways or harsh lighting, which are harmful to the cave environment. The cave is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved in Europe—and indeed the world. For on the story, go to the link in bio.
