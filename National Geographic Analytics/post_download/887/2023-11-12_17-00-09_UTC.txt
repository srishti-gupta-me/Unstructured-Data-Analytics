Photo by @joelsartore | Found in Southeast Asia, the paradise tree snake has a secret talent: it can fly! Now, it canâ€™t fly in the traditional sense like bats and birds, but it can glide from one tree to the next, covering distances of more than 30 feet (10m). It does so by stretching its body into a flattened strip using its ribs and propelling itself forward. Photo taken at Singapore's Mandai Wildlife Reserve.
