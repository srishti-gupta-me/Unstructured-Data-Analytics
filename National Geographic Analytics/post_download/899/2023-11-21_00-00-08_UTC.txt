Photo by @mattiasklumofficial | A polar bear and her cubs take a well-deserved snooze after devouring a bearded seal. Polar bears nap almost anywhere and anytime, especially after feeding. The summer sun never really sets in the Svalbard region of Norway. However, light is softer and even more gorgeous at night. I usually choose to work the "night shift" since the polar bears (and other species) tend to be more active thenâ€”as do their prey. But day and night distinctions do not mean that much in the Arctic, which has 24 hours of daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness during winter. Please follow me @mattiasklumofficial for more.
