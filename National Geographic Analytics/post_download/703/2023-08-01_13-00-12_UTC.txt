Photo by Robbie Shone @shonephoto | Emerging from the intense heat of a steaming hot lava tube, three intrepid scientists are relieved to reach the surface, having just explored one of Earth’s youngest caves. This 350-meter-long (1,150-ft-long) lava tube, which has five entrances, formed during the eruption of the Fagradalsfjall volcano in Iceland only two years ago. For the team’s microbiologists, it is important to sample now, while the cave is still relatively untouched. They are searching for signs of life in this hot, hostile environment, as it could provide clues as to extraterrestrial life beneath the surface of our planetary neighbors. @laventaexploringteam
