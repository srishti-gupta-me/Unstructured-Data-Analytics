Photo by @drewtrush | A camera trap I installed caught this black bear patrolling its territory in the Black Canyon of the Yellowstone River in Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park. Black bears are found throughout the park, and can weigh up to 300 pounds (135 kg). They're inherently curious and always manage to destroy my camera setups when they start investigating. This bear knocked over the fixture soon after the picture was taken.
