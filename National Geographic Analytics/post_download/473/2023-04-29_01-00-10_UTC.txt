Photo by Orsolya Haarberg @fjellheimengalleri | One of the most special photographic experiences of my career was encountering the Hverfjall crater in all its winter finery, with a full moon and the frozen MÃ½vatn lake in the foreground. This memorable scene occurred 12 years ago in March, during a three-month stay in Iceland. Hverfjall is one of the largest and most beautiful volcanic craters in the world. It last erupted about 2,500 years ago and is a well-known Icelandic landmark. Please follow @fjellheimengalleri for more images, primarily from the Nordic countries.
