From birth, this young pup will spend most of its life in the sea, only occasionally coming out onshore. That means its fur needs to be kept in tip-top condition. Mum does this at first and grooms her pup meticulously. Sea otters have the warmest fur of any animal, with up to a million hairs per square inch. They rely on it to keep warm, even in the freezing seas of Alaska, but it requires constant grooming. Historically, sea otters came close to extinction throughout much of the range because of fur trappingâ€”their dense warm pelt being highly prized. But strict laws protecting them in the United States has helped rebuild their population. One of the biggest threats that sea otters face in the waters off California these days are great white sharks.
