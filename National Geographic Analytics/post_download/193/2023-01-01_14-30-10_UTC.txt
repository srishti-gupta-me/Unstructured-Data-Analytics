Photo by Orsolya Haarberg @fjellheimengalleri | Northern fulmar glides over drift ice in the Arctic Ocean. Except for their breeding season, northern fulmars spend their lives on the open seas, flying over large areas in search of food. They catch squid and small fish, among others, near the surface. Please follow @fjellheimengalleri for more images, primarily from the Nordic countries. #Norway #Spitsbergen #driftice #Svalbard #BrashIce #Seaice #ArcticOcean #ArcticSea #AtlanticOcean #Arctic #Northernfulmar #Fulmarusglacialis #Fulmar
