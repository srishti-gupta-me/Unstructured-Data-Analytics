Photo by @joelsartore | Who knew two rodents could be so cute? But these Mongolian gerbils are also what we call “desert tough”—they've learned how to survive even under the most extreme circumstances. In the semideserts and steppes of Mongolia, this species developed long legs for jumping and running away from predators; teeth to deal with hard seeds and plant matter; and water conservation techniques that allow them to survive in an unpredictable climate.
