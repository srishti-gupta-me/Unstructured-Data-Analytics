Photo by @beverlyjoubert | A young male lion may exude physical strength and force in this wilderness, but a little help is always welcome. For these famously social cats, there is always much to be gained from teamwork. And for young males, coalitions are a strategic choice for improving the chances of success and survival. Most often formed by siblings or cousins from the same pride and powered by strong bonds forged as young cubs, these coalitions help males to gain and secure territory, and access better feeding and mating opportunities. In the often unforgiving landscape of Botswana’s Okavango Delta, that’s an allegiance worth having. To see more of my work, follow me @beverlyjoubert.
