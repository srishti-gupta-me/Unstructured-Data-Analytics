Among other threats, habitat fragmentation and destruction have played a major role in the decline of these most iconic of the big cats—globally, their numbers have dropped by around 43% in just the past two decades. This is why conservation efforts must focus not just on preserving existing habitats—like the lion stronghold of Botswana’s Okavango Delta—but also on reconnecting fragmented landscapes, to create mosaics of interconnected wild spaces where these predators can roam and thrive.
