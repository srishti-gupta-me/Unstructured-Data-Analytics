Photo by Prasenjeet Yadav @prasen.yadav | Snow leopards evolved to live on high-elevation deserts and cliffs, and every part of their body shows signs of this adaptation, including the long, thick, furry tail. I was lucky enough to see a snow leopard chase an ibex on a cliff, and that's when I witnessed how essential—and incredible—their tails are. Snow leopards have the longest tails, proportionally, of the big cats—nearly as long as the rest of their body. The tail can be up to a yard (a meter) in length, and it helps the animal balance on steep, rocky slopes. The tail also protects against the cold, as the leopard can wrap it around its nose and legs while resting. Snow leopards patrol their territory, and one of the ways they mark their land is by spraying urine and scent on stones. In this image, a snow leopard approaches a scent-marking location in India's Spiti Valley, in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, triggering the camera trap.
