Photo by @stephenwilkes | I love visiting Italy's Cinque Terre area. Stunning Manarola is Cinque Terreâ€™s most iconic view. I was amazed by how the colorful houses contoured the cliffs they were built upon. Throughout the day, the light and color would change by the minute. To see more from my travels near and far follow me @stephenwilkes.
