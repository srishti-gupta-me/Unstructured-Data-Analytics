Photo by @beverlyjoubert | They're alert and watchful even during a thirst-quenching stopover at a rainwater pan in Botswana’s Okavango Delta. Though lions don’t need to drink every day—they can rely on the blood of their prey for a good portion of their moisture requirements—a convenient water source in the heat of the day is not to be passed up. I've witnessed so many fierce and violent facets of lion life, making a peaceful moment of rest and refreshment soothing to observe.
