Photo by @acacia.johnson | Pilot and flight instructor Heidi Reuss, 87, sits in her Taylorcraft airplane in Anchorage, Alaska. Since much of the vast terrain in Alaska is inaccessible by road, flying small planes is an important part of its culture and infrastructure. Reuss, well known in the state’s aviation community, has taught countless students to fly in her 60-year flight career.

“When I fly, I'm free,” says Reuss. “That's what I feel like. And if I fly the Taylorcraft—that’s my baby—it does what I want it to do. I don’t have to tell it what to do. It becomes part of your body. You think ‘turn,‘ and it turns.” Follow me at @acacia.johnson for more stories from Alaska and beyond.
