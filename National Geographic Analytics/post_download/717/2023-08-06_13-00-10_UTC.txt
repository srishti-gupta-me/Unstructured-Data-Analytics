Photo by @dina_litovsky | Shuffleboard is the most popular game among Amish and Mennonite vacationers when they visit Pinecraft Park, a community park in Pinecraft, a small neighborhood in Sarasota, Florida. For many decades, Amish and Mennonite families from around the United States have been taking winter vacations in Pinecraft. The strict rules of Anabaptist life are temporarily relaxed while hard work is replaced by leisure and recreational activities, including group sports. For more photos, follow me @dina_litovsky.
