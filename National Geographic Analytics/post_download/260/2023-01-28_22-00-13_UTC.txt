Photo by @javier_aznar_photography | The flowers of a cannonball tree, on long stalks projecting from the trunk, are large, beautiful, and aromatic. The tree is named for its  cannonball-shaped fruit. In contrast to the flowers, the fruit releases a fetid scent at maturity, when it hits the ground and breaks open, attracting different animals.
