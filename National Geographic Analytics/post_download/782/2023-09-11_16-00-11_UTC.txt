Photo by @brentstirton | Kaudulla, Sri Lanka: Sri Lanka is an agricultural nation, with a great deal of crops planted in former elephant habitats and, in many cases, very close to national parks. I returned a few times to this area where elephants would cross out of the park to raid crops or visit an ill-conceived garbage dump. I wanted something at night because that felt more surreptitious and cunning. These elephants are smart and know exactly what they are doing, and I wanted a different-looking image that maybe had a little of that. My dominant thought was that I was running out of light; the sun had gone down, and the moon was rising. I needed it to be late and to have the blue tone, but I also needed to freeze the elephant as it stepped over the electric fence. Fortunately, cameras are amazing these days, and we can work in conditions like this. I was on a 400mm lens lying flat on the ground with a tarp over me, handholding and trying not to breathe. Iâ€™m sure this elephant knew I was there, but he got tired of waiting and eventually stepped over in just the right place. 

The magazine story talked about the pressure elephants are under from habitat loss as human development expands. This picture felt as if it could be part of that conversation. Read the full story at the link in bio.
