Photo by @brianskerry | Two harp seal pups meet on the pack ice in Canadaâ€™s Gulf of St. Lawrence, touching noses as they sniff each other. Pups are generally born in this region during February and need to spend about two weeks nursing from their mothers before heading off on their own. But the decline of sea ice over the past decade has created a serious situation for these animals, and pup mortality rates have increased substantially. If the climate continues to warm and sea ice disappears, the future is uncertain for this species
