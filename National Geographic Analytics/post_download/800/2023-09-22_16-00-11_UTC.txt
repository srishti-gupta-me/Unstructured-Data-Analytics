Photo by @beverlyjoubert | Ivory burns are a complex and often contentious conservation issue. Since the first public destruction of stockpiled ivory took place in Kenya in 1989, many others have been conducted around the globe. Though controversial, these events do send a strong and highly visible message against elephant poaching and the ivory trade. With more than 100,000 elephants killed illegally a year, the future of elephants still hangs in the balance. 

Photographing the historic and record-setting burn in Kenya in April 2016 was a profoundly moving experience. The confiscated ivory at this burn represented 10,000 elephants. By destroying stockpiled ivory on such a massive scale, Kenya took a stance against the plunder of its wildlife and demonstrated its refusal to reduce these magnificent creatures to mere commodities. With the red intensity of the flames against a smoke-darkened sky, the scene felt like bearing witness to a kind of mourning ritual, releasing the spirit of these animalsâ€”a return of thousands of tusks to the earth.
