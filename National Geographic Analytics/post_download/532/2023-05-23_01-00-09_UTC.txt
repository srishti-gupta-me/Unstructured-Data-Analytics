Photo by Bethany Mollenkof @fancybethany | Against the backdrop of a family quilt in Tennessee, my mother holds my daughter when she was a few months old. The image is part of an ongoing photo project I call When Did You Begin? I explore themes tied to ancestry, family archives in the digital age, pregnancy, aging, and the evolving nature of motherhood.
