Photo by @amivitale | Lekupania cradles an orphaned gerenuk at Reteti Elephant Sanctuary in northern Kenya. Gerenuks are long-necked members of the antelope family. Their numbers are falling, largely because of habitat loss and fragmentation. Today there are fewer than 100,000 in the wild. 

Mostly known for its elephants, @r.e.s.c.u.e also takes in other species, including giraffes, rhinos, and gerenuks. Then it nurses them back to health and returns them to the wild. Learn more and get involved by following @amivitale and @r.e.s.c.u.e.
