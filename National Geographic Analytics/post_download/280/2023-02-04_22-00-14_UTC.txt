Photo by @nicholesobecki | To understand aging, researchers look for clues in animals, such as those studied by the 51-year-old Amboseli Baboon Research Project in Kenya. As part of that work, Benard Oyath and Jackson Warutere prepare to take blood and other samples from Olduvai, who was tranquilized and then released back to the wild. The project’s scientists have found that baboons with strong social connections in adulthood can recover from harmful health effects of a stressful childhood. I am glad to see Olduvai included in the January 2023 magazine story about the science of longevity and how to live longer and better.
