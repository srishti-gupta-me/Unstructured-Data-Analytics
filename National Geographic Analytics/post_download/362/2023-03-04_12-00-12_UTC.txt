Photo by @jasperdoest | Sometimes you come across people who brighten your world. Mert Akkök is one of those. We came across him as Floortje Dessing and I traveled overland from Amsterdam to Nepal in search of human-animal relationship stories.

Akkök plays the flute for his beloved animals in his living room, a place of solace and comfort for the 70+ strays he has welcomed and rescued on his farm just south of Istanbul. He joined a growing number of city dwellers moving to the countryside, where he cares for his four-legged friends. His blind horse, Reyhan, is drawn to the mellow sounds of the music and has even damaged his saxophone in her enthusiasm.

Through it all, Akkök's door remains open, providing his furry family with a safe haven. “We enjoy each other's company,” he says. “They're like my kids now, and I would only give them to decent and good people who can take very good care of them.”
