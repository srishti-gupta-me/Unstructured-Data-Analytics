Photo by Prasenjeet Yadav @prasen.yadav | A snow leopard locks eyes with a camera trap while making a scrape mark, a communication tool among the cats. Snow leopards scrape their back legs in loose soil, leaving a small depression with a mound of soil adjacent. Along with field researchers of @snowleopardtrust, I scouted the Himalaya mountains looking for  locations to set up camera traps. These scrapes as well as urine spray marks were good signs of how frequently the snow leopards visit a particular location. On average, snow leopards visit this ridge once a month.
