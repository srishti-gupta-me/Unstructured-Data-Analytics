Photo by Robbie Shone @shonephoto | Scientists race against time in their search for life inside lava tubes formed by Iceland's Fagradalsfjall volcano. Though formed two years ago, the lava tubes are still new and extremely hot, so researchers must wear cumbersome heatproof suits and airtight masks for protection. Working swiftly as their oxygen tank dwindles, they take samples for microbial studies. Similar to an astronautâ€™s mission, it's a search for life in extreme environments. @laventaexploringteam
