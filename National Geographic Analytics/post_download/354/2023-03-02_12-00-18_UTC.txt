Photo by @moisessaman | Tiebele, a village in southern Burkina Faso, has some of the best preserved remaining examples of traditional painted Burkinabe architecture. 

Crafted from mud and designed to allow for ventilation, the houses are then finished with coats of decorative paint that protect the dwellings from the rain. Despite the local kingâ€™s determination to preserve traditional ways of home construction, most locals have moved outside the royal court, or compound, in order to be able to build with concrete or in other nontraditional ways. There is a popular perception that concrete equates to modernity and that earth bricks are a symbol of poverty and backwardness. In addition, some local Christian and Muslim clerics see traditional architecture as an extension of animist beliefs, so they advise residents against living in mud-brick homes after they have converted to Christianity or Islam. NGOs and community elders are pushing back, hoping that cultural and ethnic identity will persuade some families to reembrace their cultural architecture tradition.
