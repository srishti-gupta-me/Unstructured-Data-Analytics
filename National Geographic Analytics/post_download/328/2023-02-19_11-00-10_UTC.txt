A proposed road connecting the nearby communities of King Cove and Cold Bay is the subject of a decades-long controversy: While residents of King Cove want improved access to medical care via the all-weather airport at Cold Bay, the road would cross through a globally important bird and wildlife habitat in the Izembek refuge. The land swap required to build the road would also upend a decades-old law that protects tens of millions of acres of Alaska's public lands, setting a precedent that could endanger all of the state's wildlife refuges.
