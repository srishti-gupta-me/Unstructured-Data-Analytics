Photo by @joelsartore | Meet Bin, an endangered northern yellow-cheeked gibbon, photographed @eprc.vietnam. Gibbons like Bin are exclusively arboreal, meaning they spend almost all their time in trees, trying to avoid touching their feet to the ground. While this might seem impossible, it's actually quite easy for gibbons thanks to their extra-long arms. This species uses those lanky forelimbs for brachiationâ€”a form of movement in which primates swing from tree limb to tree limb using only their arms.
