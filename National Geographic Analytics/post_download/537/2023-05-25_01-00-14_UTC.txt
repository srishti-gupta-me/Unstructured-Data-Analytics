Photo by @jasperdoest | In Żabice, Poland, love is in the air as white storks clatter their bills to strengthen their bond. It serves as both a ritual greeting and a means to shoo away rivals during copulation. And what's remarkable is that the bird does this even as they hatch from the egg—despite having neck muscles not quite strong enough to perform the clattering well. These intricate behavioral patterns are deeply rooted in their genes. Life is truly awe-inspiring. Follow @jasperdoest for more images of the wonders of nature.
