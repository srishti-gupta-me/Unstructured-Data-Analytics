Photo by @beverlyjoubert | Each step forward in protecting the world’s elephants from the scourge of ivory poaching brings us a little closer to winning the fight for their future. Just recently, scientists made progress in developing a rapid test capable of distinguishing between elephant and mammoth ivory. This promises to help close off loopholes that allow mammoth ivory—a trade that remains legal—to be used for covering up illegal sales of elephant ivory. Whether it’s scientists in the lab, wildlife rangers on the ground, or people who spread awareness and support conservation causes, it takes each one of us playing our part to safeguard the world’s dwindling wildlife. #elephants #elephantivory #elephantpoaching #notourstotrade
