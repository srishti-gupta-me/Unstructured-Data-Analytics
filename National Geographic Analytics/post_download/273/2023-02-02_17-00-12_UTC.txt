Photo by Orsolya Haarberg @fjellheimengalleri | On a cold December day in Sweden's Sarek National Park, I came across this male ptarmigan. As I approached slowly, the bird did not fleeâ€”and I spent the whole day near this spot. For most of the day, the bird stayed under the cover of its snow cave, leaving the burrow only at the end of the day to feed.
