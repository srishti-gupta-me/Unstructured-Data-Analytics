“The Navajo elders asked me to be their ears, their eyes, and their voice. I was chosen; I didn’t want to. I cried. But that’s what both Navajo traditional elders and Hopi traditional elders told me to do. That’s my job now. So one minute I am over there, one minute I am over here. I went to the United Nations in Geneva to report what was happening to the people 16 times. As long as I am in good health, I will carry the message. That’s all I am: the message carrier."

I thank Grace for her words and time. For more portraits and stories in this series, follow me @martinschoeller.
