Photo by @estherhorvath | Dennis Kærgård Larsen, a soldier at Station Nord, Greenland's northernmost research and military base, trains the station's two dogs, Obelix and Dirk, for sledding. Work in this place is solitary, and the dogs are companions to those posted at the remote site for long periods. As a photographer covering Arctic stories, I found one of the most beautiful things was interacting and bonding with these local dogs. Please follow @estherhorvath for more polar stories.
