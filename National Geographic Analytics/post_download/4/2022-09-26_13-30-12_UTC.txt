Photo by @jasperdoest | A white stork searches for leftovers at a landfill in Portugal. Not too long ago, the white stork was a wholly migratory species that would breed on the European continent and migrate to Africa during the winter. However, since the 1980s, the year-round food supply at landfill sites like this one has resulted in the establishment of resident stork populations on the Iberian Peninsula. 
 
The landfills have influenced the migration and facilitated the colonization of new areas. Now, with changes in EU waste legislation, open-air landfills are being replaced by facilities inaccessible to birdsâ€”which will again likely come with consequences for the storks' winter habitat, breeding, and migratory decisions.
