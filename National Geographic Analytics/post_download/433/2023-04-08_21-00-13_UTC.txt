Photo by Matthieu Paley @paleyphoto | In the Asturias region of northern Spain, the incredible Naranjo de Bulnes peak, known as Picu Urriellu in the Asturian language, reveals itself. A few years ago while traveling in the area, I was surprised to find this beautiful mountain range, called the Picos de Europa, and I decided to return for more. Here you can trek up to high pastures in the morning and later surf along the coast after a nice lunch. For more insights into our world, follow me @paleyphoto.
