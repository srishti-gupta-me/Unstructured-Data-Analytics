Photo by @beverlyjoubert | Wildlife migrations resonate with us humans on a profound level. They are a reminder of the tenacity of life and the remarkable adaptability and resilience of nature. Africa is the stage for some of the planet’s most iconic migratory spectacles, and it is hard to imagine the continent without them. At this time of year, the grasslands of Kenya’s Masai Mara fill with the bellowing of vast herds of wildebeest on their famed cyclical trek, in search of lush grazing grounds. The significance of extraordinary journeys like this one goes far beyond just their visual splendor. Migrations are critical to the delicate balance of ecosystems, stitching habitats together and infusing vitality into landscapes. With threats like climate change and ever expanding development now placing so many migrations at risk, we have a shared responsibility to protect them.
