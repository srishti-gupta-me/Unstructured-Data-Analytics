Photo by @acacia.johnson | A floatplane withstands a winter blizzard at Lake Hood Seaplane Base in Anchorage, Alaska. With only 20% of Alaska accessible by road, planes provide essential services to dozens of its remote communitiesâ€”as well as a way for people to access Alaska's wilderness. 

The world's busiest seaplane base, Lake Hood is home to over 1,000 aircraft that use the facilities year-round. During winter months, when floatplanes such as this one are taken out of the water, the frozen lake surface is maintained as a runway for aircraft equipped with skis.
