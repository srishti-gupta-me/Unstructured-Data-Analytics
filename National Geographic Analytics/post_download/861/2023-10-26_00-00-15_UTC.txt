Photo by @alessandro.cinque | With a National Geographic Society grant, I'm on a long-term project in the Andes to capture how Indigenous peoples coexist with the foreign mining companies around them. For years I focused on Peru, and now I've expanded the project to Bolivia and Ecuador.

This particular workday had not gone well, and I returned to town in search of a restaurant for dinner. Often when I've had a bad day, I just start taking pictures of everything around me. I was captivated by this empty street near the main market. The light and colors reminded me of the American painter Edward Hopper. Suddenly a woman appeared from a market door to my right. I hoped she would continue on her way, thus entering the frame. We didn't exchange a single word, but she gave me one of my favorite photos taken in Boliviaâ€”and changed the mood of the day.
