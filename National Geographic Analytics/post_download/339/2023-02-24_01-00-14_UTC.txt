Photo by @moisessaman | Maxim Kiemdrebeojo, 17, has been living at an orphanage in Kougoudouli, Burkina Faso, since 2009. The building, made with laterite brick, was designed by Francis Kere, a Burkina Faso-born architect and globally renowned advocate of ecosensitive architecture. Some of the children housed at the orphanage are from communities displaced by conflict in the north and east of the country, while others have been given up by their desperate parents for economic reasons.
