Photo by @paoloverzone | The mummy known as KV21B undergoes a CT scan at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. This and another mummy, KV21A, were found in the KV21 tomb located in the Valley of the Kings. Discovered by Italian archaeologist and explorer Giovanni Belzoni in 1817, the tomb was later re-excavated by American archaeologist Donald P. Ryan in the 1980s. Some Egyptologists think KV21A and KV21B might be 18th dynasty queens, so further analysis of DNA samples and CT scans are being conducted to determine the mummies’ origins and family tree. Egyptian archaeologists such as Zahi Hawass consider KV21B a candidate for the body of Nefertiti.
