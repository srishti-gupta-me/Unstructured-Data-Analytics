By analyzing samples taken during a record-setting swim from Hawaii to California, scientists have discovered the Great Pacific Garbage Patch—the biggest cluster of floating marine debris in the world—is teeming with life. Creatures that float near the surface, such as blue sea dragons and by-the-wind sailor jellies, mixed in with the waste in much greater quantities than previously realized.
The abundance of life suggests that efforts to entrap the garbage in these gyres could do untold damage. According to study senior author and marine biologist Rebecca Helm, "dragging massive fishing nets on the surface might have a massive impact on the life there. It might create a much larger problem than the problem we already have with the plastic." Instead, efforts should focus on keeping plastic from entering the ocean in the first place, she notes.
