Photo by @timlaman | The reefs within Indonesia's Raja Ampat archipelago are the richest in the world in coral and fish species. Here's a lush example of underwater lifeâ€”a photographic gift when two groupers passed through in perfectly complementary positions to balance the scene. With incredibly diverse reefs, one rarely lacks for subject matter, but creating a readable image out of the "chaos" can be a challenge. When a scene liike this comes together, it's very satisfying. You can see more of my underwater imagery from Raja Ampat @timlaman.
