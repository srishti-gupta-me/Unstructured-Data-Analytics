Photo by Orsolya Haarberg @fjellheimengalleri | Despite their size, Eurasian elk—here in Sweden (and known as moose in North America)—are not easy to spot. They mostly lie still, ruminating and resting during the day. Throughout the summer, they'll gain weight—muscle and fat—a store that will come in handy during the exhausting mating season. Please follow @fjellheimengalleri for more images. #elk #moose #alcesalces #sarek #laponia #sweden #wildlifephotography
