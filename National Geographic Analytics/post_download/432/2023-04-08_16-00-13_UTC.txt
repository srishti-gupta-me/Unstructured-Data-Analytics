According to ancient Hindu mythology, it's believed that immersing oneself in the holy Ganges and Yamuna Rivers—which converge in Prayagraj (also known as Allahabad)—during the Kumbh Mela washes away one's sins and purifies the soul.

Called a "half" Kumbh Mela, the event occurs in between the much larger Maha Kumbh Mela, which is held every 12 years, when the celestial alignment is considered particularly auspicious. The next Maha Kumbh Mela will be in 2025. It's the largest religious gathering in the world, with an estimated 70 million pilgrims drawn to the area over two months.
