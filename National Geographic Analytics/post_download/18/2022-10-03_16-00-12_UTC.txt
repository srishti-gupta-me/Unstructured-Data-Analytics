Hyenas have an extremely powerful bite force, allowing them to crunch through thick bones to get to the marrow within—why their poop is often white. Despite their reputation as scavengers, they are also efficient hunters, working alone to run down prey or together as a pack. The big cats that hyenas share the plains with—the lions, leopards, and cheetahs—rely on ambush and short bursts of speed. Hyenas use stamina to bring down prey, chasing animals down until they tire.
