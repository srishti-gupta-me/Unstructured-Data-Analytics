Photo by Prasenjeet Yadav @prasen.yadav | The five-day Diwali festival of light is celebrated across India in the fall. The holiday's name is derived from the row (avali) of clay lamps (deepa) that Indians light outside their homes to symbolize the spiritual victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. 

On this auspicious occasion, I'm sharing a picture of light in darkness. A few years ago, I was in the Western Ghats when I captured this meteor during a time-lapse. The camera was set at a 15-second exposure for 999 frames, and this meteor showed up in one of the shots. The green hue comes from a meteor's metallic mix, ignited as the rock enters Earth's atmosphere. Follow me @prasen.yadav for more photos.
