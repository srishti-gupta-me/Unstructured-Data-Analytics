To boost the archipelago's resilience in the face of climate change and what's known as a blue economy—a sustainable living from the sea—the Seychelles exchanged its mounting national debt for dedicated ocean protection. In the “debt for nature” swap, the Nature Conservancy, a U.S. nonprofit, took on the debt in exchange for protection of its ocean areas. The initial pledge included creating 13 marine protected areas.
