Photo by @babaktafreshi | The National Geographic app opens with this image of the night sky above Utah's Capitol Reef National Park. Designated an International Dark Sky Park, it's indeed one of the darkest places I've visited for nighttime photography. Captured here under the Milky Way and the stars of the Summer Triangle is Capitol Gorge. It's a popular trail by day, but at night you're alone with the striking sounds of nocturnal species. My colleague and I used dim red light during the walk to preserve our night vision and to avoid disturbing animals. That's why in some national parks the light painting technique—using bright light to illuminate landscape at night—is forbidden. It helps keep the night environment natural.
