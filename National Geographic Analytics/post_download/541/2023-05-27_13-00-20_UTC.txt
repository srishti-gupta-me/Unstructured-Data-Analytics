Photo by @tasneemalsultan | Built more than 3,000 years ago, the Karnak Temple includes the shrine of Seti II, which  was a sanctuary for the sacred boats of Amen-Re, Mut, and Khons during harvest processions. You can see engravings on the shrine walls including in the middle chapel, home to the golden-necklaced sacred bark of Amen-Re with the head of a ram.
