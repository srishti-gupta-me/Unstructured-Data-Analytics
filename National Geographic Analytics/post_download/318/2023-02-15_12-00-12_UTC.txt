Photo by @hannahreyesmorales | Birds fly over the city of Hatay, Turkey, at dusk. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians who fled the conflict in their country have taken refuge in this area near the Syrian border. 

I made the image in late 2019 for a story on lullabies. I  documented Syrian families who took lullabies with them as they left, passing them on to children as a way to preserve a sense of home and safety amid destruction. 

It's hard to find the words when I see images of the aftermath of last week's earthquake here. For families escaping conflict, the disaster intensifies an already extremely difficult situation. Please consider donating to reputable organizations working on the ground.
