Photo by @heidihanskoch | The rump of a brown kiwi looks like the fruit that bears its name. Wispy feathers—much like human hair—don’t support flight but they do help the bird blend in with the undergrowth of the New Zealand forests where it lives.

We got an offer to photograph two private feather collections and those of the National History Museum in Berlin. Feathers are encounters with the irresistibly beautiful in nature. We wanted to present them as a sensual experience, as poetic masterpieces of evolution. 

For this project, we used the method of focus stacking, in which similar photos with different focal planes are blended to achieve a more profound depth of field. Gradually our engagement with nature and technology developed into a kind of meditation. In the end, it took us more than two years.
