Photo by @timlaman | A misty morning in the cloud forest of the Arfak Mountains, West Papua, Indonesia. The forests of the great island of New Guinea are the most intact in the Asia-Pacific region. Both Papua New Guinea in the east and the Indonesian provinces in the island's western half have over 80% of their forest intact, representing both a carbon store and biodiversity. I’ll be sharing more @TimLaman as I continue to explore Papua’s forests.
