Photo by @orsolyahaarberg | Old pine trees (Pinus sylvestris), a dead one and a living one, watching over the majestic Geirangerfjord in Norway. The sides of the fjord valley reach steep into the sea from the snow-covered mountaintops to the bare shoreline in winter. The Geirangerfjord, together with the Naer√∏yfjord, is the only natural site in Norway inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
