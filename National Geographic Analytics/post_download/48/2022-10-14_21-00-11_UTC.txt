Photo by @beverlyjoubert | In the maelstrom of the hunt, the outlines of victory are shifting and unpredictable. These two ancient enemies know each other well. They are wise to the other’s strengths, the favored maneuvers, the well-honed tactics … but also those Achilles' heels that can be exploited to turn the tide of the battle to your own advantage. For every hunt that ends in triumph and feasting, there is another that sends lions fleeing from the buffalo's ferocity. #lions #bigcats #buffalo #wildlife
