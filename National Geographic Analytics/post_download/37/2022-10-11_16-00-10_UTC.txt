Photo by Orsolya Haarberg @fjellheimengalleri | In the string bogs of northern Swedenâ€™s Muddus National Park, water forms meandering, wet labyrinths. To get around in this environment, you must either be able to fly or swim. In the summertime, the mires are full of nutrients and a refuge for hundreds of species of birds that nest here. Out on the open mire, whooper swans build large nests in dense tufts of grass or sedge, called tussocks. Even though you can see the nests from afar, they are completely safe. Neither foxes nor other predators can reach them in this waterlogged environment. Please follow @fjellheimengalleri for more images, primarily from the Nordic countries. #muddus #sweden #aerial #landscapephotography #autumn #aapamire #stringbog
