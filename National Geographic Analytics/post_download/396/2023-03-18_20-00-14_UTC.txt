Photo by @nicholesobecki | A haboob, or sandstorm, rolls across the Meroë pyramids in Sudan. Most of the 41 tombs here belong to the royals of the powerful Kingdom of Kush (900 B.C. to A.D. 400), which ruled large parts of the middle Nile Valley. Watching the wall of sand move toward us across the desert, amid the echoes of ancient kings and queens, was a moment I’ll never forget.
