Photo by @amivitale | Happy World Animal Day! Head rhino keeper Zacharia Mutai relaxes with Najin, one of the last two northern white rhinos on the planet. Zacharia, with Najin's other keepers, has had a front-row seat as the Biorescue Project works at @olpejeta conservancy in northern Kenya to restore this iconic species. 

Despite tremendous pressures on rhinos around the world, we have reason to celebrate. In September, the Biorescue Project announced the creation of five northern white rhino embryos, bringing the total to 22. This nourishes hope to produce offspring and give this keystone species a new future. Follow @amivitale @biorescue_project and @olpejeta, to learn more including how to help.
