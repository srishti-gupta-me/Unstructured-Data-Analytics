Al Ma’wa sanctuary in Jordan offers a second chance for animals rescued from mismanaged zoos and war zones, or confiscated from smugglers. As of April 2023, more than 2,280 animals had been rescued and offered a permanent home at the sanctuary. Our photographer Muhammed Muheisen (@mmuheisen) has visited the sanctuary regularly since 2018 documenting these creatures’ lives. His work has historically focused on people caught in the middle of chaos, on human misery and destruction—but now he's turning his lens on the animals who were also victims of conflict. Read about their stories and rare happy endings at the link in bio.
