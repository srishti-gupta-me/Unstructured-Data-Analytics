Photo by @sofia_jaramillo5 | A rancher in eastern Washington State adjusts a harness. Ranchers not only help their animals to graze but do everything from applying topical medications to prevent parasites, lice, and ticks and vaccinating them against common diseases, to castrating and branding cattle. Multigenerational ranching and farming operations are scattered throughout the state. For more images from the rural Pacific Northwest, follow @sofia_jaramillo5. #ranching #washington #PNW
