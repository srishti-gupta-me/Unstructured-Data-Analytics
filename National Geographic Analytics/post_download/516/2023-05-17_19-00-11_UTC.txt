Photo by @beverlyjoubert | Just because they’ve learned to adapt to the watery demands of Botswana’s Okavango Delta doesn’t mean the lions here won’t take the opportunity to keep their paws dry. For a cat, leaping is usually preferable to wading. Yet it’s impossible to avoid the spillways and channels of this drenched landscape entirely. To survive, the lions must venture out in search of prey—and that means risking run-ins with lurking crocs and temperamental hippos. Watching a big cat at the water’s edge, you can sense the tension and nervous energy as it prepares to leave the relative safety of terra firma. To see more of my work, follow me @beverlyjoubert.
