Photo by @luisadorr | Brenda is a member of ImillaSkate, a women's skateboarding group in Cochabamba, Bolivia.

Brenda and her mother are Indigenous Aymara and considered to be pollera women because of the colorful traditional skirts—polleras—they wear. Brenda started skateboarding 6 years ago and found that it gave her direction and helped her overcome fear. "It makes me feel capable because I can break my own limits and I can dare to do things that I have never thought about," she says. "And like this I can get over my daily fear."

It's very hard to skateboard wearing a voluminous skirt, but Brenda has been improving her skills through perseverance and practice. For her, skateboarding with ImillaSkate represents her roots, the place she comes from, and who she is.
