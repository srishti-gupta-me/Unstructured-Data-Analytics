Photo by @brentstirton | I was working with bat hunters who had just harvested bats from a nearby island and were now on their way back across the powerful, fast-flowing Congo River, in the Republic of the Congo. I needed to see the bats and the men in the same environmental frame. At the same time, I was holding onto the side of the canoe with one hand and trying to remain steady with the other, attempting to keep my gear dry. My biggest concern was being able to see the tiny but key subject matter in the middle of a chaotic scene and capture a dynamic frame. I think that kind of informational but also aesthetic thinking is at the heart of a good National Geographic photo. This story was about wild meat, its sustainability, and the consequences of hunting and eating it. It was the peak of COVID-19, and these bats were proven reservoirs for several diseases that had jumped from animals to humans through consumption. Read the full story at the link in bio.
