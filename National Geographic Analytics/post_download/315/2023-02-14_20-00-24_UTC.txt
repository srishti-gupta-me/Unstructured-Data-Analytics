Photo by @yagazieemezi | When I was asked to choose an image to tie to Valentine’s Day, I pondered which one could hold all the meanings we often place on the day. Then I remembered this 2018 portrait of Shari, Kobby, and their son in Accra, Ghana. It was a favorite photographic moment for me—I had the joy of being welcomed into it. They've since divorced but happily co-parent. I reached out to them for their permission to once again share the sweet family scene along with their feelings about it. Here's what they said:

"It was such a profoundly tender picture. We had friends and family reach out for weeks after it first went online, either complimenting us or telling us they would never have shared such an intimate shot. We wanted to blow it up, frame it, and hang it over our bed. It captured something of what we wanted our family to be.

Much has changed since then. Yet thankfully some things have not. It remains crucial to us both that he continues to know what love looks like; that he still feels as safe and as held as he was in the picture. And that starts with how we treat him and each other—with respect and kindness, patience and genuine care. We want him to know that love isn't just roses and Valentine's Day cards. Sometimes, it's messy, hard-won, and unconventional. But we too are what love looks like. And we're very proud of that."
