Photo by @lynseyaddario | In 2021, at her Redenção home in Brazil's Para state, female chief O-é Kaiapó Paiakan has her face painted by her aunt, Tuire. Tuire has been outspoken about the harmful effects of climate change on Brazil's Indigenous communities, and O-é Kaiapó Paiakan, a member of the Mebêngôkre people of the Kayapó tribe, is also a leading voice on the issue. 

Her father, the iconic Kayapó leader Paulinho Paiakan, passed away from COVID-19 in June 2020, and the 38-year-old took the reins as her people's first female tribal chief in March. She's intending to carry on her father’s legacy as a pioneer of Brazil’s Indigenous environmental movement. 

As climate and environmental threats worsen, the roles of women are changing too. They've always been seen as powerful figures but are now stepping out of the confines of their homes to attend college and take up male-dominated spaces. "Kayapó women have always been fighting,” O-é Kaiapó Paiakan said. “From us, resistance is born. From us come men, children, life. The woman completes herself with nature, and we have always been part of the resistance along with the men.” 

According to a recent report by the watchdog group Global Witness, Brazil—which includes a large part of the Amazon—was among the deadliest countries for environmental defenders, with 20 activists killed in 2020 alone.
