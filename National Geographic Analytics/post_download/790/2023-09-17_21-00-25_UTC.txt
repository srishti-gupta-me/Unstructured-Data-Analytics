Photo by Robert Clark @robertclarkphoto | Several years ago, I was assigned a story for National Geographic magazine on the evolution of dog breeds. Photo Editor Kurt Mutchler and I worked with the Hotel Pennsylvania, the "bedroom" for all the dogs that are in New York City for the Westminster Dog Show. The approach was to set up a studio in one of the hotel's dozens of ballrooms. We roamed around the lobby and hallways to look for dogs to come and have their portraits made. Leo was a wonderful Afghan to work with. At his studio appointment, everything was going well. Leo was like a professional model, beautiful and well behaved, as are a lot of show dogs. We were only a few minutes into the shoot when the door to the ballroom-studio was opened, and Leo saw an opportunity. I will never forget how fast he was as he headed out the door. The funny thing is that every Afghan I have photographed has taken the opportunity to run. I should have known better. It is just in their nature. That worked well with the title of the story, "How to Build a Dog," and the idea that dogs have been transformed from a common ancestor, the gray wolf, into what man needs: a guard dog, a hunting partner, a guide dog, or a best friend.
