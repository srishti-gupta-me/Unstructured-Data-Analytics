Photo by Becky Hale @beckythale | Watching Buzz Aldrin walk into the National Geographic studio in 2015 was a “pinch myself” moment. I distinctly remember thinking, He’s real. Like, a real actual person.

Aldrin occupies a special place in the national identity of the United States. He is more cultural icon than actual flesh-and-blood person and became a household name in 1969, when he was the pilot on the Apollo 11 mission with Neil Armstrong and walked on the moon. Yet here he was in the photo studio. And I was adjusting his collar.

Our days at National Geographic headquarters can be wild. One minute we’re photographing a cicada on a stick and the next moment Buzz Aldrin. #WorldSpaceWeek
