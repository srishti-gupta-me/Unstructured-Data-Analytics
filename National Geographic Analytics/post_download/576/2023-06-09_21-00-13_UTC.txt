Photo by Robbie Shone @shonephoto | I’m currently in Iceland, working on a story about life inhabiting newly formed, steaming-hot lava tubes. The expedition to the Fagradalsfjall volcano has been a success. Lead by National Geographic Explorer Francesco Sauro, the team has identified a new lava tube that's 350 meters (yards) long and accessible from at least five entrances. This is one of the youngest caves on Earth. The conduit is still very hot, with temperatures varying between 50 to  300 degrees Celsius (120 to 575 degrees F). Scientists have sampled dozens of metastable minerals, and microbiologists are working to find the first bacteria that colonize these extreme environments. Stay tuned, as there’ll be more to come. @insidenatgeo
