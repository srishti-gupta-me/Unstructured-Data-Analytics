Photo by @kiliiiyuyan | A young guanaco—also known as a chulengo—greets its mother while tasting the air with its lips withdrawn. A South American relative of the camel, guanacos gestate for an entire year, then stay with their mother for another. That two-year commitment to its chulengo is one of the longest in the animal world and is a mother’s gift of survival to its offspring. Follow me, @kiliiiyuyan, for more love between the human-animal worlds.
