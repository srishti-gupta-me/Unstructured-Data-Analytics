On December 18, Argentina won its first FIFA World Cup in 36 years. In my country, soccer is not only a sport; it is an indescribable passion that’s difficult to explain logically. Almost all Argentines grew up linked to fútbol in one way or another, and Lionel Messi is a national idol who had to overcome several battles to finally win the cup. In a very critical moment for my country—amid great environmental, social, and economic crises—this triumph means the possibility of at last celebrating something united. In a world of enormous inequality, a Latin American country has the opportunity to be victorious in front of all the rest.
