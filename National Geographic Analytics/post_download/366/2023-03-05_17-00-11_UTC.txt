Amidst the mist, dedicated relatives tend to the graves of their loved ones, their silhouettes barely visible against the wooden crosses. Their diligent efforts are a testament to the enduring bond between the living and the deceased, and the sun struggling to break through the fog is a symbol of hope and renewal in this timeless place.
