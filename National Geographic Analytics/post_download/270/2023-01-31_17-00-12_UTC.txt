Photo by Robbie Shone @shonephoto | In Italy's Buso della Neve del Zingarella, time is recorded in layers upon layers of ancient ice—stored in this giant plug wedged between the rock walls of the cave. For Italian geologist and explorer Francesco Sauro, this is a special cave. Sauro recognizes the importance of sampling and studying this ice now, before it melts away and crashes to the floor, disappearing forever. In "When the Magic Melts," in the October issue, author Denise Hruby and I document the contributions of scientists—and tour guides—as they work against the clock in this rapidly disappearing landscape.
