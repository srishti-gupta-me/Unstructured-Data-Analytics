Photo by Robbie Shone @shonephoto | While on assignment to photograph melting ice caves in the Alps, I observed that the  formations inside Eiskogelhöhle in Austria (pictured) have not changed much since my first visit there, in 2013—the volume of ice is still the same. One possible theory could be that due to its high elevation, this cave carries cooler winds throughout the year and never really gets warm enough to melt the ice. It's over 500 meters (1,650 ft) higher than Schwarzmooskogel, which is melting fast. In "When the Magic Melts," my article in the October issue, author Denise Hruby and I document the contributions of scientists—and tour guides—as they work against the clock in this rapidly disappearing landscape.
