Decades’ worth of research links physical activity and exercise with positive changes in the brain in a variety of contexts. Imaging studies confirmed that the volume of the hippocampus—a region of the brain important in learning and memory—is larger in individuals who are more aerobically fit compared to their sedentary peers.
