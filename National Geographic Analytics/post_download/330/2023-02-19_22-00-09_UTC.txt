Photo by @brianskerry | Happy World Whale Day! A pod of orca swim off Dominica. Orca sightings are quite rare in the Caribbean, and these are believed to be the first images of orca near Dominica. There were eight animals in this group. For more on whale culture, go to the link in bio. #WorldWhaleDay #Orca #Whales
