Photo by @joelsartore | A family of endangered François’ langurs @theomahazoo. Found in southern China and northeastern Vietnam, these monkeys are good jumpers, with a long tail that they use for balance and long, hairless fingers that are used for gripping. When they’re born, infants are bright orange for the first three or four months, allowing them to be highly visible in the thick forest to the multiple females that will care for them, a process known as allomothering.
