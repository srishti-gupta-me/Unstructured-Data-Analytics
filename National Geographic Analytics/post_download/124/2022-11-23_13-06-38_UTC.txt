Photo by @stephenwilkes | I was recently in British Columbia, on Chilko Lake, the traditional territory of the Xeni Gwet’in First Nations, scouting for a new photography site, when we witnessed a mother and a few grizzly bear cubs playing and gorging on what looked like a limitless supply of salmon. In the fall, millions of salmon return to the lake to spawn at the Chilko River's mouth, creating an incredibly rich food source for the bears. I’m looking forward to sharing more images from this remarkable experience. Special thanks to the incredible team @bear.camp for the amazing support.
