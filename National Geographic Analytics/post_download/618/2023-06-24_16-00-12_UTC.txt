Photo by @daviddoubilet | Indonesian marine scientist Nesha Ichida prepares to release a juvenile zebra shark named Kathlyn into a patrolled marine protected area in Wayag Lagoon, Raja Ampat Islands. Zebra sharks used to thrive here before overfishing wiped out the species.

ReShark, a growing global conservation coalition, is putting sharks back into the sea. The network of aquariums it partners with provides zebra shark eggs that are shipped by air and sea to two nurseries in Raja Ampat. The embryos grow and emerge from their eggs as baby sharks called pups. When they’re able to fend for themselves and grow large enough to fend off predators, they’re released into their future to rebuild the population.
