Photo by @joelsartore | A mandrill and her infant sit for an intimate portrait at the Gladys Porter Zoo in Brownsville, Texas. Mandrills usually give birth to just one baby, which is born with the ability to immediately open its eyes and cling tightly to momâ€™s belly. At just two months old, infants will begin to lose their baby hair, as their adult coat starts to grow in. They will stay close to their mothers until she gives birth to her next baby, at which point she will push older offspring away and turn her full attention toward caring for her newborn.
