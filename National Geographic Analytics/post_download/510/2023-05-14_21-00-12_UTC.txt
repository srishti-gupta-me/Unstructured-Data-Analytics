Photo by @hannahreyesmorales | Today on Mother’s Day, I am thinking about Princess and her baby. I met Princess in West Point, a thumb of land between Liberia’s capital, Monrovia, and the Atlantic Ocean. She was 16 when she gave birth. When I took this photograph of Princess and her baby, it felt as if for a moment these two were floating in the night sky. 

In Liberia, about one in three girls are mothers by the time they’re 19. At the news of her pregnancy, Princess’s mother sent her away from home. The baby’s father refused to recognize the child as his own. Princess named her baby Anointed so he would be blessed, even without his father. She and Anointed are staying at her friend’s house until she can afford a space of her own. At night, before he sleeps, she sings playfully about her dreams for herself and for Anointed: “The boy will buy my car; the boy will build my house.”
