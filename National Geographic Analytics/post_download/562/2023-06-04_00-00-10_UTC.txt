Photo by @sarahyltonphoto | I often get asked why I choose to photograph with a camera—medium format—that's older than me. This image of Lake Vembanad in India's Kerala state  illustrates my answer. 

There are constraints with the analog process: I may fumble while reloading film, it can take too long to focus, or it's too dark for the film to properly work. But my answer to this question comes easy: It makes me more intentional in my vision. I slow down and I feel the magic in every photograph that comes to life in a negative. So while I "miss" many opportunities, each photograph that emerges holds meaning—and isn't that the point? For more on this dispatch, go to the link in bio.
