Photo by Michaela Skovranova @mishkusk | The eastern gray kangaroo, found in Australia's southeastern state of Victoria, can often be seen in grasslands and shrubsâ€”or hopping through a golf course, grazing during dusk and dawn. They are widespread, and in some areas, they can become overabundant and cause damage to farmland and properties. Protecting natural habitat and fostering an environment where native vegetation can thrive helps create safe areas for them and may keep them away from populated areas. #Nature #Wildlife #Kangaroo #Macropod #Wurundjeri #YarraValley #Victoria
