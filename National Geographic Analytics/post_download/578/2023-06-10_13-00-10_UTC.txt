Photo by @noralorek | Mary Emba learned to embroider by copying the designs she saw on fabrics as a tailor in South Sudan. When civil war forced her to flee to Uganda alongside thousands of other refugees, she took only her children. Now sheâ€™s starting life over in Bidibidi refugee camp, where she works with the @milayaproject, a nonprofit organization that emerged out of a National Geographic article I photographed with writer @ninastrochlic. The Milaya Project features women who make ornately embroidered bedsheets called milayas. 

For decades, war in South Sudan has forced refugees back and forth between their homes and Uganda. Bidibidi, with more than 250,000 people, is now one of the world's largest refugee settlements. For more on life there, go to the link in bio.
