Photo by @amytoensing | A relocated lynx, released near Colorado’s Weminuche Wilderness, begins his new life. Trucks, airplanes, and a snowmobile brought this male from Canada to a holding facility where he adjusted to the higher altitude and ate a high-protein diet to bolster him for hunting in unfamiliar territory. 

After decades of trapping, poisoning, and loss of habitat from human development, the lynx disappeared from the Colorado landscape by the 1970s. Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) managed a seven-year program, starting in 1999, to bring the cats back—trapping them in Canada and releasing them in Colorado. There were lots of ups and downs, but in the end, it was named a success. Today CPW estimates that there are 150 to 250 lynx living in Colorado. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service continues to list the cat as threatened in the lower 48 under the Endangered Species Act. According to the National Wildlife Federation, the lynx’s biggest threat today is habitat destruction and fragmentation. Visit @amytoensing to see more images.
