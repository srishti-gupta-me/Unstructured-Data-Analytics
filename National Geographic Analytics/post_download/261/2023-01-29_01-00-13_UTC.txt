Photo by David Chancellor @chancellordavid | In South Africa, each morning I rise before dawn, drawn into a land of light punctuated by the sounds and scents of the wild. Slowly the forms of lions materialize from the darkness. Frosty footprints are left in the crisp air, leaving with the warmth of the sun. From a world of mystery and darkness, the land is quickly transformed into the Africa that I love. Another day is born before my very eyes. To see more follow me @chancellordavid.
