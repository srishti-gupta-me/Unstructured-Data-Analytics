Photo by @tasneemalsultan | Outside Amman's Syrian refugee center in 2016, I walked with a group of young photographers, passing local children playing at a cemetery on the graves of their grandfathers. "We're the 'Jordanian' Jordanians, not the Palestinian Jordanians and not the Syrians," said one 13-year-old boy (right). "But we're in this together ... in war, in peace and death." In the shadow of the recent earthquakes that impacted the region, that bond is as important as it was then.
