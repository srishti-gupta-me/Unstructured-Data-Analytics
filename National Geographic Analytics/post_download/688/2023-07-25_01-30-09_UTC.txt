Iceland’s volcanic peninsula has been dormant for centuries, but a new era of volcanic activity could be on the horizon. Earlier this month on July 4, the Fagradalsfjall Volcano announced its approach when southwest Iceland was rocked by more than 2,000 earthquakes in just 24 hours. Not long after, seismic activity dropped off as magma rose to shallow depths and ultimately gave way to oozing molten rock on July 10. This eruption is the peninsula’s third in a row, following on from similar lava-spewing eruptions in 2021 and 2022—and it’s unlikely to be the last. Experts say the tectonic shifts behind the recent eruptions and earthquakes are a long time coming.
