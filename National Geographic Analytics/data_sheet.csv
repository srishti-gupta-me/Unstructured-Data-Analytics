1,2,"Photo by @beverlyjoubert | My, what teeth you have… No doubt it’s an impressive set, but unfortunately for the cheetah, not as impressive as it could be. These high-speed hunters pay an evolutionary price for their agility. Because they require large nasal passages to deliver the oxygen needed to power their impressive sprints, cheetahs are left with far less room in the skull to accommodate big teeth. Being light and lithe for maximum speed also makes them vulnerable to meal theft by larger predators like lions, leopards, and hyenas. It’s not easy being the fastest cat on the block.

3,4,"Photo by @jasperdoest | A white stork searches for leftovers at a landfill in Portugal. Not too long ago, the white stork was a wholly migratory species that would breed on the European continent and migrate to Africa during the winter. However, since the 1980s, the year-round food supply at landfill sites like this one has resulted in the establishment of resident stork populations on the Iberian Peninsula. 
 
The landfills have influenced the migration and facilitated the colonization of new areas. Now, with changes in EU waste legislation, open-air landfills are being replaced by facilities inaccessible to birds—which will again likely come with consequences for the storks' winter habitat, breeding, and migratory decisions.

In the past, many ranchers would kill the cats when they ate their cattle, but jaguars may be worth far more alive than dead. In a paper published by the journal Global Ecology and Conservation, @pantheracats biologist Fernando Tortato found that a cow in the Pantanal is worth $2,000 in its lifetime, but a jaguar in this area brings in $108,000 each year in ecotourism income.

The Pantanal is a shining example of big-cat and other wildlife tourism as one of the most profitable land-use types on Earth. This is all the more important in world so fixated on beef production and agriculture that clear forests and release carbon into the atmosphere. Local people need to benefit from living with predators, not killing them and selling their parts. A sustainable future includes people living with wildlife and an intact healthy ecosystem. Think of all the people in an area that work in ecotourism—running the lodges, driving the boats, guiding the tourists—and the families their income supports. If you save the top predator in any ecosystem, you save everything under it.

My partner and I live between Brooklyn, New York and Richmond, Virginia, and three years ago we adopted Goose from a Virginia shelter. They had rented out an empty storefront and filled it with adorable, adoptable puppies, all of which thankfully found loving homes. One of those pups was a chubby little three-month-old hound mix with dirt on his nose, spots on his ears, and soulful eyes. He slept on my lap the whole car ride home. He remained a sleepy, snuggly puppy for about 24 more hours, and then it was go time! Goose loves action, whatever it may be—playing with other dogs, fetch, running. Most of all, he loves it when all of these things can happen in water. Goose loves to swim, but he wasn’t always so comfortable in water. We first tried to teach him to swim in a pool, but he couldn't figure out the stairs. We had to carry him in. Then he couldn’t get enough. Lakes, streams, even the ocean—Goose goes right in! Watching him swim still makes me feel super proud and inspires me to be brave and overcome my own fears. // Dogs make the world a better place.

Their diets may vary by location but mostly consist of fish and krill. They're capable of diving to depths of up to 175 meters (575 ft), though they usually feed within the first 70 meters (230 ft)—an incredibly impressive feat. Once they enter the ocean, they also face predators such as leopard seals and killer whales. Fortunately, they're efficient swimmers, and they'll swim in groups to reduce their own chances of becoming a meal.

India launched Project Tiger back in 1973, and the country has 53 tiger reserves, including Kanha National Park where this picture was taken. Tiger numbers are increasing in South Asia, not only in India but in Nepal and Bhutan as well. Populations are considered stable in the Russian Far East and in areas along the Russia-China border.

Kali came home that night. What I didn’t know was that she’d spent the first year of her life in a crate in shelters, had never had a family, couldn’t walk on a leash, was scared of everything, and didn’t for one second consider herself a dog. The lost soul soon showed her true spirit in the big city, where she quickly adapted. She was smart and eager. We learned about each other—and became inseparable. In time, Kali overcame her fear of life, learned to trust, and blossomed. She soon walked the streets as if she owned them, accompanying me to restaurants, bars, and any place that would let her in.

Named after Matvei Yakovlevich Mudrov, a 19th-century physician who helped establish clinical practice in Russia, the train is operated by the state-owned Russian Railways and employs around 15 doctors who offer specialized services, including x-ray, ultrasound, neurology, and ophthalmology. For many communities along the rail line, the Matvei Mudrov represents a rare connection to the rest of the country.

In 1994, Italian explorers discovered that the lake had vanished—because the ice plugging a hole at the bottom had melted, allowing the water to drain through a narrow shaft into a 935-foot-deep ice cave known as El Cenote.

I was born in Iran in 1978 and lived there for 33 years. During that time, I witnessed women living in daily fear of the hijab police.

What remains of suitable lion habitat is under threat from human encroachment, climate change, and degradation.

A new assessment by the World Wildlife Fund warns that across the globe, populations of vertebrates (mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish) have declined by 69% on average since 1970, with habitat destruction as a leading cause in all regions. To stem and reverse these losses, we need to focus our will and energy on preserving and protecting habitats—in short, we need to make room for wildlife.

She took this costume with her on a permafrost expedition because she had dreamed of somehow finding an occasion to wear it in the far reaches of Norway, which inspired the film's fictional kingdom. With this portrait, she now had the chance. Sipes identifies with the character's call to forge her own path, and the idea, she says, that “strong females don’t need a prince.”

Her mission is to study Arctic ecosystems and the organisms that rely on them, she says, ""allowing humans to better understand the magnitude and incredible diversity that lives on our own planet."" And knowing this extreme environment better might prime us to better understand other planets, she adds.

It was also a lesson in Vietnam’s recent environmental history: Black cardamom, thao qua, an essential spice in pho and other Vietnamese dishes, was first planted in the Hoang Lien Mountains in the 1990s as a replacement for opium, a banned crop that once helped prop up Indochina’s colonial economy. The area, known as Hoang Lien National Park, is a symbol of postwar Vietnam’s efforts to protect plant biodiversity. Hence this puzzle: How could a forest simultaneously be a haven for conservation and agricultural cash crop?

Over a few days of camping in the forest, we observe farmers harvesting cherry red pods of raw cardamom with machetes beside a stream. In the afternoons, they smoked the refrigerator-size piles under fire till they turned coffee brown, significantly reducing their weight for the hike back. On our return, we stop at this spot revealing a set of lush green peaks before we dip down into thick vegetation for the remainder of our walk home.

Since 1997, this once small town has risen from a forsaken landscape and post-Soviet rubble, transforming into a futuristic city. After replacing Almaty as the country's capital, Astana grew from having 320,000 inhabitants to over 1.2 million.

Before restoring the capital's name to Astana earlier this year, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev had renamed it Nursultan to honor outgoing Nursultan Nazarbayev, who announced his resignation in 2019 after serving as the first and only president of modern Kazakhstan for almost 30 years. Since its founding as a Russian military outpost in 1824, Astana has undergone several naming iterations—in fact, the city holds the Guinness World Record for most name changes.

While taking a series of images here, I went a bit too far, and my tripod lost its grip. To avoid jeopardizing the camera gear, I fell in instead—quite a brisk experience! My great friend and assistant at the time, Lars-Magnus, helped pull me out of the ice-cold water. The amazing blue color in the back is caused by the ice absorbing red light, or long wavelengths, and scattering back and transmitting blue light, or short wavelengths.

I’m not a wildlife photographer. I don’t have the patience to sit for hours, days, or months in order to get that shot. What’s brought me here is the birth of this cub and the significance of it in terms of human-wildlife coexistence. I’m here to bear witness to the reinstatement of wildlife and ecosystems that man’s very presence has previously destroyed. A powerful symbol of the restoration and regeneration of the country’s natural landscape is the Arabian leopard. Amal (“hope”) is one of two cubs born recently at the breeding center here in Taif. The goal is that, in the not too distant future, she will contribute to the rewilding of this landscape when these truly majestic cats are reintroduced back into their rightful position as apex predators.

Gonzalez is a professional cyclist and works as a DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) consultant. She's an advocate for gender diversity in cycling and a community builder focused on creating opportunities and experiences for women of color and others in marginalized communities.

“As a queer woman of color, the act of just showing up on the trails on my bike is radical,"" she says, ""and I try to pass that message on and the joy of cycling to all folks I meet."" 

""Biking has become a huge part of my life. It’s how I move my body, exercise, and process. It’s been the main way that I’ve found more diverse and inclusive communities to be part of. I’ve learned a lot about what I can do with my body and mind while on a bike, and it’s transferred to my everyday life. The bike has made me stronger, more confident, social, aware, and gritty.”

I asked what changes she’d like to see in the outdoor community. “More of an attitude that everyone has a space in the outdoors and in nature, and less of a gatekeeping mentality,"" she says. ""I would love to see more respect and acknowledgment for Indigenous folks and their land. Indigenous sovereignty and the land back movement are so important for our climate, the outdoors, and the communities of Native folks in this country and beyond.”

207,208,"Photo by @sofia_jaramillo5 | Judith Kasiama, who also goes by Juju Milay, poses for a portrait during Roam Fest in Sedona, Arizona, a mountain biking event series for women riders. The portrait is part of an ongoing project I call Women Who Roam, which highlights women of color and those from the LGBTQ+ community who are changing the face of the cycling industry. Kasiama is the founder of @colourthetrails, a collective that advocates for inclusivity in the outdoors. 

“Biking is the freedom of mobility without barriers,"" she says. ""Biking is an opportunity to connect with other people. It’s a sense of community, it’s access to transportation, and above all, for me, it brings a lot of joy and childlike wonder.”

Based in Vancouver, Canada, Kasiama noticed barriers to mountain biking when she first began riding. She felt like the marketing by the bike industry promoted only the gnarliest, fastest, and most extreme riding, not the experiences of everyday riders. She also didn’t find anyone who looked like her in the brands’ marketing materials, which ran counter to her experience.

Through her work, Kasiama is helping adults and kids alike break down the barriers to access in the outdoors. “I know we have a long way to go, but for me, I just want more little Black girls doing stuff in the outdoors. To see someone who looks like them in these spaces and hopefully they can have the courage and feel supported in mountain biking or mountaineering or whatever it is.”

The long, powerful necks of these Rüppell's griffon vultures are almost featherless—they have to reach into some pretty horrible places to feed and feathers would be a nuisance. Their bills are curved for tearing flesh and their tongues have backward-facing serrations to grip flesh and bring it into the mouth. Their personalities often confirm their grim demeanor; they're highly aggressive and make a disturbing rasping hiss. But when they're in the air, with wings spread to eight or so feet, they're as perfect a flier as any bird.

Fiddler crabs are known for their sexually dimorphic claws—the females have two small claws, whereas the male (seen here) has a small and a large one, used to both attract females and threaten other males. The crabs play a key role in the preservation of wetland habitat, aerating the substrate as they burrow in.

The park is Africa’s most biodiverse protected area, home to over a thousand mammal, bird, reptile, and amphibian species as well as 1/3 of the world’s endangered mountain gorillas. Virunga is known as the park of fire and ice for its diverse habitats ranging from the Rwenzori peaks to savanna and volcanic plains. Despite its status, Virunga is constantly threatened by war, poaching and other illegal activities, and natural disasters. With the support of donors, the Virunga Foundation actively conserves the park, which spans over 3,000 square miles (7,800 sq km). Over 5 million people reside within a day’s walk of it, many living in extreme poverty and enduring more than 30 years of conflict. The fertile lands in and around Virunga are prime for agricultural exploitation. By preserving the land, many of the world’s poorest are forced to sacrifice opportunity.

233,234,"Photo by Matthieu Paley @paleyphoto | Like many of my colleagues, I get often asked, “How do you become a National Geographic photographer?” My answer is often that you don’t “want"" to be a National Geographic photographer; you just want to be a photographer who pursues a story like your life depends on it. That story must keep you up at night and make your heart beat faster. If you pursue it and work your craft, good things will invariably come. But it takes time—years. It’s not always easy, and aspiring photographers can be too impatient. 

This photograph is from a story I worked on and off for more than 15 years, in Afghanistan’s Wakhan Corridor. It had turned into an obsession, requiring multiple expeditions in every season, learning the language and the landscape, and dealing with stress and joy. The image was taken in 2017 in a high pasture in the Pamir mountains, reachable after a two-week-long expedition. Sidol (at left), Jumagul (center), and Assan Khan were returning on their yaks after monitoring the growth of grasses at lower elevations. Herds would be kept off that pasture so the grasses could be harvested, dried, and used by the Wakhi people for animal fodder in the winter months. I was talking on the satellite phone with my wife on a hill when I saw these beasts climbing up toward me. I had to hang up … and was forgiven!

It's an experiment to test whether  underwater greenhouses could be an agricultural option for arid coastal countries that must put resources into desalinating water for crops. 

Each dome has a platform that allows divers to partially enter the shell (as seen in the foreground). Plant cultivation is based on the hydroponic technique, whereby soil is replaced by a substrate that contains the nutrients and minerals needed for plant growth. As sunlight penetrates the humid domes, it leads to further condensation, generating the water source for the plants. Since no pests can penetrate the environment, it also doesn't require the use of chemical pesticides.

But this photograph tells only one part of their story. In 2011 Will was evicted from a retirement community where he shared an apartment with Adina, a longtime companion. He moved into another assisted-living community nearby, where he met Jeanie. They connected immediately. Torn between Adina and Jeanie, Will tried to maintain a relationship with both. Eventually, after a period of discomfort, conflict, and uncertainty, Jeanie and Adina accepted the unconventional dynamic. “There are many different kinds of love,” said Adina. Jeanie, Will, and Adina formed a trio, often spending days roaming around the east side of Los Angeles. Their relationship challenged sociocultural norms and stereotypes about how older adults should live their lives. More than anything, their time together revealed ageless questions about freedom, romantic love, the nature of intimacy, and what constitutes a relationship.

I’ve spent days and days sitting calmly, waiting and watching these magnificent creatures. Although it can be frustrating (I’m not a patient person), I’m extremely happy to find that my work is becoming more difficult, more complex, with the arrival of each new cub. Here, we see the latest one. 

Born at the Arabian leopard breeding center in Taif, Saudi Arabia, these apex predators will one day be released back into this ecosystem. The center is operated by the Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU). This winter, RCU is releasing more than 1,500 Arabian gazelles, sand gazelles, Arabian oryx, and Nubian ibex into their ancestral habitat. The last piece of the puzzle will be the return of the Arabian leopard. Before that happens, the land will need to be re-greened to support the prey, as the pyramid of a functioning ecosystem rises from the desert sand. One day, this leopard will sit in these mountains and watch from a great distance as people walk by, unaware of its presence. Until then, the longer it takes for me to see it here, the better its chances of survival are in the wild. 

Today, February 10, marks the second Arabian Leopard Day, which sheds light on the plight of this majestic creature and the conservation work under way to ensure its survival.

The nasal cavity houses particularly large and thick mazes of bone and tissue called turbinates.

Yes. Some species, such as macaques and baboons, will often make communication gestures known as lip-smacking, which can lead to contact with the lips. It usually occurs between adult female monkeys and their young infants. 

Aside from kissing, monkeys will hug and groom each other. Grooming is a way to show affection and respect.

Then I remembered this 2018 portrait of Shari, Kobby, and their son in Accra, Ghana. It was a favorite photographic moment for me—I had the joy of being welcomed into it. They've since divorced but happily co-parent. I reached out to them for their permission to once again share the sweet family scene along with their feelings about it. Here's what they said:

""It was such a profoundly tender picture. We had friends and family reach out for weeks after it first went online, either complimenting us or telling us they would never have shared such an intimate shot. We wanted to blow it up, frame it, and hang it over our bed. It captured something of what we wanted our family to be.

Much has changed since then. Yet thankfully some things have not. It remains crucial to us both that he continues to know what love looks like; that he still feels as safe and as held as he was in the picture. And that starts with how we treat him and each other—with respect and kindness, patience and genuine care. We want him to know that love isn't just roses and Valentine's Day cards. Sometimes, it's messy, hard-won, and unconventional. But we too are what love looks like. And we're very proud of that.""",164903,https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/330856751_1608928569556487_5882725772023170932_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=IGAmdzAnI8sAX-m_Qkl&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAJyT4WyNp0rrqBNC1ir--p8l5jtv7_k9DqblUHODrI6g&oe=65D6CBAF&_nc_sid=bc0c2c

Despite the local king’s determination to preserve traditional ways of home construction, most locals have moved outside the royal court, or compound, in order to be able to build with concrete or in other nontraditional ways. There is a popular perception that concrete equates to modernity and that earth bricks are a symbol of poverty and backwardness. In addition, some local Christian and Muslim clerics see traditional architecture as an extension of animist beliefs, so they advise residents against living in mud-brick homes after they have converted to Christianity or Islam.

The Maasai had been grazing their cattle inside the reserve in day and night shifts, bringing them into regular contact with the local lions.

It was exhilarating and terrifying to photograph—on foot—at night, and I was amazed by the bravery of the guys, who would run right up to the lions, throwing stones to scare them off.

Alaska's sled dog racing season is currently in full swing; it's a tradition with over 3,000 years of history in the Arctic Circle. Indigenous communities there used sled dogs long before Europeans bred the animals for transportation and hauling as they colonized the region in the 19th century. It wasn’t until the 1960s, when highways were built and snowmobiles became widespread, that dogs were no longer needed for transport. Still, the practice of mushing, as traveling by sled dog is known, remained a cultural and recreational activity in communities across the Arctic, and the world of competitive racing began.",55751,https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/332763765_220739200328564_3177483525574184194_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=Jt2TCsPYa34AX8-Wi3x&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfB-PnHlTxGPOxWrzeHyE1jipQkeOtEoQcnwzbPIkW3RAA&oe=65D71519&_nc_sid=bc0c2c

A physiotherapy student, Belén would like to match her career choice to her passion. She started skateboarding 4 years ago because she was amazed by the balance skills and the level of difficulty of the maneuvers. She'd like to use her knowledge as a physiotherapist to help skateboarders.

""Imilla"" means ""girl"" or ""young lady"" in Quechua and Aymara, the most widely spoken Native languages in Bolivia. 
“We want to motivate the female skateboarding scenario in Bolivia so this sport can grow and we can get more spaces to practice—so we can participate in sports tournaments around the world as other athletes do,"" says one member of the skating group. ""Another thing we want to do is to show that no matter how you look, how old you are, or what’s your gender, you can be part of the skate community and feel the freedom of skateboarding. We believe that everyone deserves respect, and we must get rid of discrimination and mistreatment towards people who are different from you. Diversity makes beauty.”

""My whole family lives on the reservation. My brother has danced all his life; my mom was a shaman, a medicine woman. In '03 my brother comes to me and says, 'Fill out this paperwork for eagle feathers.’ I am going, ‘what?’ I had shunned the Native life; I was a businessman living in faraway California. I had been the CEO of two companies, but still I gave the order and sent it to the fish and game department in Colorado. Three years later, a big box showed up with dry ice and I pulled out a frozen bald eagle.

So I started plucking the feathers and at night I start dreaming of dancing with the Old Ones. One morning I woke up, I saw  face paint on me and a badger on my head. I turned to my wife and said, 'I want to start dancing.'"" 

Edwards's passage refers to the ability of Native Americans to apply to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for access to eagle carcasses, parts, and feathers, which are used for ceremonial or religious purposes.

345,346,"Photo by @richardbarnes | I have been photographing a National Geographic story on repatriation for the past 3 years. Repatriation concerns the return of objects mostly from European and American museums to the countries or peoples that originally produced them. Some of the artifacts were given under duress, and others were looted outright, but still others, such as the Nefertiti bust, now in the Neues Museum in Berlin, may have been obtained legally. It's no secret that colonial powers were rapacious in the theft of objects sacred to the people who created them—from the Benin Bronzes looted in a British raid in 1897 to the Mandu Yenu throne, whose return the Bamun kings in Cameroon have been seeking for decades. It's a complicated and nuanced debate: Some former colonial powers, along with museums including the Smithsonian Institution, embrace return or transfer of control, and others justify their position by claiming that many of the objects in their collections would never have been preserved if it were not for a globe-trotting curator or colonial overlord who recognized their value and saved them from neglect or ruin. Nonetheless, I have witnessed a sea change since I started this project, with many museum directors, curators, and concerned government officials advocating for return in as conscientious and equitable a way as possible.

Although the species is common in some areas, there is little data about it. A recent study that called the frog ""an underexplored source of bioactive peptides"" found three new antimicrobial peptide families in the skin secretions of the frog—a reminder that we must protect its habitat. As we bring many animals to extinction, we are destroying opportunities to find cures for diseases such as cancer and to discover new antibiotics for multiresistant bacteria among other substances. 

Thanks to nonprofits such as @fundacion.jocotoco, this region of Ecuador and the species that inhabit it have a chance to survive. Follow @javier_aznar_photography to discover some of the animals in the rainforests of South America. #ecuador #frog #animals #wildebeest

He joined a growing number of city dwellers moving to the countryside, where he cares for his four-legged friends. His blind horse, Reyhan, is drawn to the mellow sounds of the music and has even damaged his saxophone in her enthusiasm.

For years the breeding secrets of pandas stymied scientists. When China first established a panda breeding program, it was not successful. Pandas were thought to be a species without sex drive. But scientists eventually cracked the puzzle of captive breeding. The secret? Re-create the conditions that appeal to the particulars of this picky animal. Scent, it turns out, is critical and so is male competition. Males will carefully scent different parts of the body and the nearby enclosures to broadcast their odor. Female pandas are in estrus just once a year for 24-72 hours, so timing is critical.

424,425,"Photo by @estherhorvath | When I met Alyse Dietel in Iceland this January, I sensed an inner strength I couldn't quite put my finger on—until I learned of her story and her conviction to achieve the impossible. 

In 2012, Dietel, then a professional climber, fell 80 feet (25 m) from a cliff while on a hike with a friend. She ended up with a shattered pelvis, a broken tailbone, ankle, and ribs, two fractured vertebrae, a partially collapsed lung, kidney damage, a sprained neck, and numerous bruises and lacerations. Doctors told her she might never walk again. Before the fall, she was at the peak of her climbing career and had competed nationally for the U.S. for eight years. 

Her doctor's words were inconceivable. But she believed in herself, and with a will to walk and climb again, she began a healing process that included a mental strength regimen. Her goal was one year to heal. At eight months and one week, she was standing. Three weeks later, she was getting around on crutches. The following month, she went to a climbing gym and completed the easiest route. Soon after, she was back on the cliffs. Today she climbs just for the pure joy of it and now works as an artist, illustrating nature, wildlife, and pets. 

When I met her, she was in Skagaströnd for a month-long residency. One morning we went to see the Icelandic horses before sunrise—which was then at 11:30 a.m.

440,441,"Photo by Aaron Huey @argonautphoto | This post honors Karma Tsering Sherpa (1930-2023), who I was lucky enough to spend some time with while working on a story about Sherpas for the magazine in 2013. Karma was known and loved by many of us in the photographic community. I learned of his passing when his grandson, Pemba, announced that, as his Buddhist faith teaches, the spirit of Karma had completed the 49th day seeking a rebirth in a journey after life into a new existence. 

It reminded me of his mantra. He'd recite it on our many walks and in his home, day and night (almost inaudibly but still incessantly). With these six syllables, he hoped he and all other living beings would be released from the cycle of suffering that is birth, death, and rebirth: “Om mani padme hum, om mani padme hum, om mani padme hum... "" 

To the people of Nepal's Khumbu Valley, each syllable is its own powerful prayer. The syllables represent a release from different realms of suffering: ""Om"" for ego and pride, ""ma"" for jealousy, ""ni"" for passion and desire, ""pad"" for ignorance and prejudice, ""me"" for greed and possessiveness, and ""hum"" (sometimes ""hung"") for hatred and aggression.

And so, asked for or not, Karma prayed for all of us climbers wandering through his Himalayan backyard, reciting the mantra thousands of times a day, counting each on a long string of beads, like all the elders of the valley do. In the Khumbu you cannot avoid ceremony, even if you wanted to. The air is full of prayers and sacred smoke. It's inhaled and cleans you out without express permission; you are blessed for just having walked there. Now, after his 49 days of seeking, Karma is reborn. We celebrate you, Karma!

444,445,"Photo by @martinedstrom | Kvikkjokk, a township in Sweden's Lapland region, has seen many changes over the years—and indeed continues to evolve. In the 17th century, the area was the domain of the Indigenous Sámi people, until prospectors found silver in the mountains and developed the area for mining, which was soon abandoned.
⁠
Today Kvikkjokk is a hub for Sámi communities working in the traditional reindeer trade. It's become a major tourism destination at the literal end of the road, a place where people jump off a bus or park their car to head into one of Europe's largest wilderness areas.

Here, wildlife veterinarian Mércia Ângela takes her daily walk with Boogli, a female Cape pangolin. Gorongosa National Park’s law enforcement team confiscated Boogli, along with a leopard skin, as a 2.2 kilogram (5 lb) infant; Boogli’s mother had already been sold. Mércia was one of Boogli’s caregivers, working with her every day as she was raised to adulthood. A few weeks after I shot this photo, Boogli was released back into the wild. 

The Gorongosa team now rescues pangolins from all over central Mozambique, rehabilitating them as needed, then releasing them. Pangolins are the world’s most trafficked mammal, as many people wrongly believe their scales have medicinal value. In reality their scales are just made of keratin, the same material as our hair and fingernails.

459,460,"Photo by @erintrieb I Happy Earth Day! On a recent climbing expedition in Mexico, the group I was photographing successfully summited the peaks of La Malinche (14,640 ft, or 4,460 m) and Iztaccíhuatl (17,343 ft, or 5,230 m). They planned to finish the trip climbing Pico de Orizaba (18,620 ft, or 5,675 m), the highest peak in Mexico and third highest in North America. We were well on our way to the top until one team member developed acute mountain sickness just 1,800 feet (550 m) shy of the summit, and we had to turn back. Downtrodden, I reluctantly descended and made the seven-hour commute back to Mexico City. But when I arrived at the capital, I impulsively turned around and drove all the way back to the base of Orizaba to give the summit another shot, this time alone and on just a few hours of sleep. There was an itch that needed to be scratched.

I find mountain climbing to be an exhilarating yet strange and elusive pastime. The legendary mountaineer Reinhold Messner captured my sentiments perfectly when he said, “Mountain climbing is no fun. It is a place where you learn to cope with pain because it’s painful. When the pain is forcing you to go down, you keep going up.”

When I'm walking above the clouds in almost perfect silence, apart from the sound of my heart beating and the crunch of hardened snow beneath my feet, a mental game ensues. I am forced to face my most primal, internal fears fueled by self-doubt—a constant battle and dance of “I can’t do this, it’s too hard, I want to quit” versus “I can do this, keep going, just one more step.” Ultimately, I persuade myself to put one foot in front of the other, slowly and patiently, committed to keep moving forward with every raspy gasp for air. Some might call it a metaphor for life.

Her father, the iconic Kayapó leader Paulinho Paiakan, passed away from COVID-19 in June 2020, and the 38-year-old took the reins as her people's first female tribal chief in March. She's intending to carry on her father’s legacy as a pioneer of Brazil’s Indigenous environmental movement.

Here, a malnourished African penguin chick is weighed as part of routine monitoring on an island off the coast of South Africa. Without sufficient fish close to colonies, penguin parents must travel increasingly farther to find food, making it difficult to successfully raise their young. The food scarcity is a result of overfishing as well as changes in air and ocean temperatures, which affect the availability of sardines.

One place where they and other LGBTQI+ people encounter some of the greatest discrimination is Uganda. Last month the 2023 Anti-Homosexuality Bill was introduced in the Ugandan parliament. The country’s penal code already punishes homosexual relations with life in prison. This bill would further criminalize people simply for identifying as LGBTQI+. It also includes the death penalty for so-called aggravated homosexuality and life in prison for gay sex. 

Kasha Jacqueline Nabagesera is a leader in the fight for LGBTQI+ rights in Uganda. The new law, if adopted, would mean she could be arrested just for identifying as a lesbian. These laws, and anti-LGBTQI+ rhetoric, also leads to an increase in hate crimes. Kasha knows this all too well. When I was producing my project @whereloveisillegal, Kasha shared her story. “People have threatened me with death many times,” she said. “They want to cut off my head, kill me.” While she continues to live with this fear, she also lives with hope.

I met Princess in West Point, a thumb of land between Liberia’s capital, Monrovia, and the Atlantic Ocean. She was 16 when she gave birth. When I took this photograph of Princess and her baby, it felt as if for a moment these two were floating in the night sky. 

In Liberia, about one in three girls are mothers by the time they’re 19. At the news of her pregnancy, Princess’s mother sent her away from home. The baby’s father refused to recognize the child as his own. Princess named her baby Anointed so he would be blessed, even without his father. She and Anointed are staying at her friend’s house until she can afford a space of her own. At night, before he sleeps, she sings playfully about her dreams for herself and for Anointed: “The boy will buy my car; the boy will build my house.”

“If pilots can have a job flying in the region they’re from, not only will they know the area, the weather, but they’re going to be invested in their community and the people that are riding in their airplane,” Klaes says. “For me, creating rural pilots doesn’t just create jobs, it creates more of a safety network for the aviation community.”

522,523,"Photo by @danwintersphoto | Two years ago I got a call from Whitney Johnson Latorre, Nat Geo’s director of visuals, to discuss an assignment. Could I do a portrait of Angelina Jolie (@angelinajolie) connected to a worldwide initiative with UNESCO and Guerlain to teach sustainable beekeeping to women in third world countries? But it was the next part that really caught my attention: “How would you feel about doing a portrait of Angelina Jolie ... covered in bees?” As both a beekeeper and a portrait photographer, I was 100% in for the challenge. And having photographed Angelina Jolie before, I knew she had the moxie it would take to pull this off—the perfect collaborator for something so bold. Photographic policy would not allow for any re-touching of the images to make this work; it would all have to be done in-camera.

I'm deeply reverent of the medium's history, and I couldn’t imagine this shoot happening without a nod to Richard Avedon’s iconic beekeeper portrait. With the help of a commercial beekeeper friend, I was able to acquire some of the actual queen bee pheromone entomologist Norman Gary formulated and applied on the subject, Ronald Fischer, for Avedon’s shoot, 40 years prior to ours. In contrast to Avedon’s portrait, I wanted it to feel like Angelina was draped in honeybees, as though they were jewels. I wanted to highlight their precious nature.

The end result was due to the efforts of the many people who helped make it happen. Those 18 minutes where Angelina stood calmly in front of my camera covered in bees to create this majestic portrait, for a cause close to her heart, catapulted her to a legend in my world. When we finished, she walked unceremoniously out the studio doors to the parking lot and jumped up and down to shake the bees from her gauzy gown. They flew away and the shoot was over. I feel grateful to have collaborated with her and @natgeo to bring attention to these fascinating and critical insects, called by some as the most important living beings on Earth.

The tomb itself is relatively tiny compared to others in the Valley of the Kings, but even after a century, its sacred aura and mystery remain intact. Today, with generations of Egyptian archaeologists looking after the boy king’s grave, Egyptology is entering a new era. Read more about the discovery of Tut’s tomb at the link in bio.

Western New Mexico is home to the Gila Wilderness—a maze of forested canyons that in 1924 became the world’s first legally protected wilderness area. Although designated to remain untouched by humankind, the wilderness and other protected areas that surround it have been shaped by thousands of years of human habitation.

White Sands contains the largest gypsum dunefield in the world, including hearth mounds—remains of prehistoric campfires found nowhere else. The park is also home to the largest collection of fossilized footprints, from the Ice Age, and tells the story of potentially more than 20,000 years of human presence. Some believe the footprints challenge scientists’ timeline of when humans first came to North America. 

An ancient sea once covered most of the southwestern United States. During that time, layers of gypsum were deposited on the seafloor. The rise and fall of sea levels millions of years ago initiated the process of making gypsum sand. More recently, astronauts have used this slice of desert, over 275 square miles (700 sq km), as a geographic reference point.

We’re likely to continue seeing it increase in severity, frequency, and longevity as the planet warms. Here are a few tips on how to reduce exposure to harmful air once it reaches a town near you:

1. Monitor local AQI forecasts
2. Wear a NIOSH-approved N95 or better mask outdoors
3. Invest in a better air filter
4. Create your own air filtration system
5. Take care of your eyes

Are organic fruits and vegetables richer in nutrients than their conventional cousins? The short answer is yes—but the long answer is more complex than you might expect. Regulations for organic food put out by the U.S. Department of Agriculture don’t focus on the health benefits. Instead, the emphasis is on how organic produce is grown, largely by protecting soil through the use of composts and animal manures and eschewing synthetic chemicals.

597,598,"Photo by @magnuswennman | Yvette Tetteh, 30, is a Ghanaian-British entrepreneur, athlete, and activist who swam about 450 kilometers (300 mi) of Ghana's Volta River to bring attention to water pollution. She swam 4 to 6 hours each day over a month as part of what she calls the Agbetsi Living Water Swim project, which focuses on textile waste in the country.

The expedition built on research into the environmental impact of textiles flowing through Ghana, one of the largest importers of secondhand clothing in the world. The Or Foundation estimates that weekly Ghana sees 15 million items of used clothing or cast-off inventory from the EU, the U.K., and the U.S. entering Accra's Kantamanto Market, where 30,000 traders sort through their purchased bales for items they can re-sell or upcycle. But today on average 40% of every clothing bale is deemed too cheap or poor quality to re-use—a trend tracking the rise of fast fashion—and it's discarded and sent to landfills. The waste has reached a tipping point; it eventually ends up on the shores of waterways, often washed down by rains, bringing with it an enormous environmental toll as well as upheaval for the local garment industry.",119782,https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/354331305_645124230994027_8148924914908612572_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=1I9qTFitXNcAX8hLxzT&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCdXnr2aXnq3OuW69hmZh8ZF6Y--oKe4FgKTcIJHZPIDA&oe=65D757A0&_nc_sid=bc0c2c

The park was vastly expanded by the Costa Rican government in 2021, providing a refuge not only for the shallow habitats around the island but also to seamount chains used in their annual migrations. Cocos and a few other protected islands in the eastern tropical Pacific function as stepping stones in the migration of sharks (and other endangered species). But their numbers have been declining steadily: outside of the few areas that are fully protected from fishing, sharks are being slaughtered. Industrial fishing targets sharks directly for the Asian shark fin market and indirectly as bycatch in tuna fisheries. And even small-scale fishers target juvenile hammerhead sharks, which are born in coastal mangroves. The future of sharks depends solely on us.

For years the breeding secrets of pandas baffled scientists. When China first established a panda breeding program, it was not successful. Pandas were thought to be a species without a sex drive. 

Scientists have finally cracked the puzzle of captive breeding and have started reintroducing pandas to the wild. The trick? To create in captivity the conditions that appeal to the particulars of this picky animal. Scent, it turns out, is critically important to pandas, as is male competition. Males will carefully scent different parts of their body and nearby enclosures to broadcast their odor. Female pandas are in estrus just once a year, for 24 to 72 hours, so timing is critical.

647,648,"It wasn’t long ago that swimmers splashed and surfers paddled along the beaches of Cape Cod with little thought that a great white shark might be on the hunt just feet away. But today, that reality is settling in among the popular seashore towns as white sharks return to an area they disappeared from decades ago for one simple reason: Their favorite prey, the gray seal, is back on the menu. Hunted nearly to extinction, the seal population began rebounding with the passage of the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972.

So, just how many white sharks are out there? That number has been hard to come by, as counting the elusive and wide-ranging predators is complicated. But researchers with the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy finally have an answer, based on an innovative combination of acoustic tracking, photographic identification, and statistical modeling. The bombshell: Some 800 sharks—and possibly up to 900—swam the waters of Cape Cod between 2015 and 2018. The findings are striking not only because of the number of sharks, but the fact that they’re concentrated along just 560 miles of protected coastline.

661,662,"In May 1845 a British explorer and naval officer, Sir John Franklin, took up the quest to find a route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through Arctic waters. With orders from the British Admiralty, Franklin and a crew of 133 sailed out from the Thames. The crew was young, tough, and seasoned. Both ships were specially equipped for polar service and carried more than three years’ worth of food and drink. Despite these preparations, the expedition failed—becoming one of the grimmest chapters in the history of Arctic exploration.

This is the largest fully protected marine area in North America, with 150,000 square km (58,000 square miles)—an area larger than Greece—under strict protection. The national park provides a refuge for whitetip reef sharks and other shark species, such as whale sharks, hammerheads, and Galapagos sharks. National Geographic Pristine Seas conducted an expedition to the Revillagigedo Islands and provided scientific research that contributed to the creation of the park, where sharks are so abundant that they can exert their ecological role at the top of the food chain. Their presence is vital for the health of the entire ecosystem—in contrast to the false perception of them as dangerous creatures. #SharkAwarenessDay

The Sonoran Desert toad is increasingly being caught by poachers, for recreation and profit, for what the toads carry in their bodies—5-MeO-DMT, a powerful psychotropic compound. The allure of the toad for its psychoactive properties is complicated because 5-MeO-DMT is currently being studied as a possible treatment for depression and anxiety. As the popularity of 5-MeO-DMT rises, the question now is about the ethics of animal use—especially when there is an alternative synthetic version of the drug. Read more at the link in bio.

The world of bugs is filled with lookalike species! False widow spiders resemble their infamous cousins, black widow spiders—but pack a much less potent bite. Like black widows, these species have markings on their abdomen, though not as bright red or as distinctive as the black widow’s classic hourglass shape. The false widow is just one example of how nature has evolved lookalikes that can make it tough for people to tell one bug apart from another.

Despite a plethora of products designed to keep birds off buildings, they're sending a clear message: Nice try.

While birds are a common urban neighbor, city residents don’t always appreciate the droppings and nesting materials our feathered friends leave behind. To keep birds off human infrastructure, light displays, netting, and even sharp metal spikes were designed. However, a new study shows that not only are some birds unbothered by long strips of barbs—they’re actually ripping the skewers off buildings and using them to build armored nurseries for their chicks.

Here are a few common questions (and answers) about the pill:

1. Besides preventing pregnancy, how might the pill help me? All birth control pills can help make periods lighter and less painful, and lower your risk of ectopic pregnancy.

2. Will I gain weight on the pill? Studies have not found that the pill leads to significant weight gain. (The ring, patch, and intrauterine devices also aren’t associated with weight gain.) It’s tricky to blame the pill for weight gain because many factors like diet and stress can contribute.

3. Does the pill increase my chances of developing blood clots? About 1 in 3,000 women taking the pill will develop a blood clot, according to the National Blood Clot Alliance. Although this is one of the most significant risks associated with the pill, it’s still extremely rare, experts say.

Iceland’s volcanic peninsula has been dormant for centuries, but a new era of volcanic activity could be on the horizon. Earlier this month on July 4, the Fagradalsfjall Volcano announced its approach when southwest Iceland was rocked by more than 2,000 earthquakes in just 24 hours. Not long after, seismic activity dropped off as magma rose to shallow depths and ultimately gave way to oozing molten rock on July 10. This eruption is the peninsula’s third in a row, following on from similar lava-spewing eruptions in 2021 and 2022—and it’s unlikely to be the last. Experts say the tectonic shifts behind the recent eruptions and earthquakes are a long time coming.

In 1847, British explorer Sir John Franklin and his crew disappeared while searching for the fabled Northwest Passage. A National Geographic team sought to find evidence of their fate—but not without obstacles of their own. The team sailed from the Atlantic into a mazelike network of channels toward the other side of the continent, off the coast of Alaska. Along the way, their boat became trapped in a labyrinth of ice floes, and with winter approaching, they—much like the ill-fated Franklin expedition—risked being stranded in the Arctic.

By analyzing samples taken during a record-setting swim from Hawaii to California, scientists have discovered the Great Pacific Garbage Patch—the biggest cluster of floating marine debris in the world—is teeming with life. Creatures that float near the surface, such as blue sea dragons and by-the-wind sailor jellies, mixed in with the waste in much greater quantities than previously realized.
The abundance of life suggests that efforts to entrap the garbage in these gyres could do untold damage. According to study senior author and marine biologist Rebecca Helm, ""dragging massive fishing nets on the surface might have a massive impact on the life there. It might create a much larger problem than the problem we already have with the plastic."" Instead, efforts should focus on keeping plastic from entering the ocean in the first place, she notes.

Decades’ worth of research links physical activity and exercise with positive changes in the brain in a variety of contexts. Imaging studies confirmed that the volume of the hippocampus—a region of the brain important in learning and memory—is larger in individuals who are more aerobically fit compared to their sedentary peers. Now scientists are learning how muscles in motion can improve cognition and shield against diseases like Alzheimer's, paving the way for new treatments.

From before the rise of Athens to the height of the Roman Empire, one of the most sought-after products in the Mediterranean world was a golden-flowered plant called silphion. It cured diseases and made food tasty, but Emperor Nero allegedly consumed the last stalk. Since the Middle Ages, botanical explorers inspired by ancient accounts of this miracle plant have sought it on three continents, and always in vain. Many historians view its disappearance as the first recorded extinction of any species, plant or animal. But is silphion truly extinct? Thanks to a lucky encounter almost 40 years ago—and decades of subsequent research—a professor at Istanbul University suspects it's not.

For nearly four centuries until around A.D. 1600, a community of Icelanders on the west coast buried their dead on the tiny island of Haffjarðarey. Centuries later, waves and rising sea levels began to expose bones eroding from the island cemetery. Archaeologists excavating this ancient cemetery in 1945 found only bodies—a Harvard University-sponsored scientific expedition showed up earlier and removed the skulls.

Today, the missing crania sit in cardboard boxes on steel storage shelves in a Harvard museum basement. There’s interest by researchers in both Iceland and the U.S. to reunite the skulls with the rest of their bodies that are located at the National Museum of Iceland in Reykjavik. It’s not only good science, archaeologists argue, but also the morally and ethically right thing to do.

Mounting evidence shows that more young adults are experiencing heart problems compared to decades past, and that worsening lifestyle habits—namely, poor diet and lack of exercise—are to blame. And some research suggests that COVID infections are adding insult to injury. Perhaps the most alarming trend is that, despite declines among older adults, the proportion of heart attacks among younger adults is increasing across the globe—which many doctors who spoke to National Geographic consider a public health emergency. Young adults are loosely defined as those between 20 to 50 years old.

Cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack—but ""the really important thing for young individuals to know is that cardiovascular disease, for the most part, can be prevented if you take the right steps,"" says Ron Blankstein, senior preventive cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston. The AHA recommends following key measures that can improve and maintain your cardiovascular health. These include a healthy diet, regular physical activity, no tobacco smoking, and sufficient sleep, as well as managing your weight, cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure.

The designation of the land as a national monument, confirmed to National Geographic this week by the White House, will prevent new uranium mines and protect historically significant tribal lands. The decision by @potus is the culmination of a lobbying effort by a dozen tribes who have historical ties to the site and advocated for its monument status. It will be called Baaj Nwaavio I’tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument—the Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument.

The site encompasses natural habitat for the critically endangered California condor and an important watershed for the Colorado River, which provides water to 40 million Americans. It’s also habitat for desert bighorn sheep, and birds including the threatened western yellow-billowed cuckoo and the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher.

Having a glass of wine or other ""nightcap"" before bed has long been thought of as a way to help someone sleep, but a look at the evidence suggests otherwise. Even a small amount of alcohol can make sleep worse by elevating your heart rate and interfering with REM sleep, for example. Drinking alcohol is also linked to a higher risk of sleep apnea, in general, and to more severe snoring and obstructive sleep apnea in those who already have these health problems.

We spoke for a while of the challenges they faced, the animals they’d lost in the drought, and the wells that had dried up. Somalia has long been a place of extremes, but climate and environmental changes are compounding those problems and leading to the end of a way of life. As the women turned to walk home, I took this image of one of them in a field of cacti. The colors of her scarf melded into the vegetation and sky, and I was reminded of how intimate the ties are between people’s lives and the land. What we call our voice is profoundly shaped by the stories we see, hear, and internalize every day. They’re how we give shape to the world beyond our own limited experience. Stories can help guide our choices, and change us—sometimes radically. I hope images like these can reenforce our connection to the natural world and break down the false pride in our separateness that enables harmful behaviors toward our shared planet and one another.

Bears know when it’s trash day, coyotes learned to look both ways before crossing the street, and raccoons can untie bungee cords. As more scientists study the creatures right under our noses, a consistent message is emerging: Many species are adapting to urban life in unprecedented ways. It’s a phenomenon happening in urban areas around the world. The more we understand the animals living in our midst, ecologists say, the better we can get along with these urban newcomers.

Katie attempted suicide when she was 18 years old after a heartbreak. She put the barrel of a rifle below her chin and pulled the trigger, destroying the front of her face and damaging her vision. When I met Katie and her family, she had gone through multiple surgeries for several years. Her parents quit their teaching jobs to care for her. Every day was spent at doctor’s offices.

Katie was always in pain. Her parents were always at her side to fight for her to receive the best treatments. Cleveland Clinic was paying for all of Katie’s medical care, as she was the youngest face-transplant candidate it had seen. Working with her might move the science of face transplants forward. Only National Geographic magazine would give us three years to work with such a fragile story in order to make honest, intimate, and informative photographs.

Some of the most important—and most endangered—tidal flats are found surrounding the Yellow Sea along the shores of China and the western side of the Korean peninsula. For decades, people have transformed them into industrial sites and farms, squeezing them into smaller areas and pushing some species to the brink of extinction. But as science increasingly shows how wetlands like these benefit wildlife and help fight climate change, South Korean scientists and conservationists are gaining momentum in their effort to save and restore what’s left—becoming a blueprint for tidal flat conservation and ecotourism.

Each morning before daylight I'd climb the tower’s narrow staircase, 90 feet (27.5 m) into the tree canopy. I’d set up my gear, take in the symphony of a slowly awakening rainforest, and spend the day, rain, shine, wind or hail (yes, HAIL!), atop the tower watching something most never lay eyes on: a harpy eagle family. For three days, mom, dad, and a tiny two-week-old chick went about their business of living. The air was sweltering, bees were interested in my lunch, sent up by pulley, and rains blasted through with little warning. As the tower swayed and the weather roiled, I made image after image. Harpia harpyja is one of the largest eagles—with a wingspan of 6.5 feet (some 2 m), rear talons up to 4 inches (10 cm) long, and a weight of 9-20 pounds (4-9kg). The female is twice the size of the male. This eagle is an elusive hunter, with legs as thick as human wrists. It feeds on sloths, howler monkeys, armadillos, baby deer, even peccaries. Not for a second was I scared … only blown away with respect for one of the most amazing raptors I’ve been privileged to spend time with. An eagle pair spends two years raising just one chick. The species is threatened by habitat loss and other human-related activity.

742,743,"Photo by @joelsartore | The International Wolf Center in Ely, Minnesota, had a ""study pack"" of wolves in an outdoor enclosure. Researchers could observe their behavior year round, and tourists would stop by to see if they could get a glimpse.

I asked what the wolves ate. One of the biologists said the roads department would bring road-killed deer up a couple times a week. They'd throw the entire carcass in, then let the wolves tear it up and devour it just as they would in the wild. I thought this might make a good opportunity for a remotely operated camera. I called it ""The Carcasscam.""

I was there for a week, which gave me two opportunities to embed a small, radio-triggered camera next to the carcass. The NG Photo Engineering Lab created a heavy plexiglass sphere with a lens port, into which the camera was placed. The device was wide enough so a wolf couldn’t get its jaws around it and crush it. The bottom of the sphere had a tripod mount so the rig could be screwed into a sheet of plywood that we placed the deer on.

The first time I tried it, all I got were pictures of the wolves’ furry throats as they ate the deer from the back side of the camera.

Two or three days later, when the second deer was brought into the pen, I moved the deer and camera to the opposite side, with lots of open plywood behind the camera. I figured the wolves would not want to walk on a hard, strange surface like that, and I was right. This time they approached to eat facing the camera, with their paws never leaving the snow. 

This photo was made at the moment the alpha wolf, a female, was snarling at pack mates to stay away until she'd eaten. The blurry area on her throat was where she'd licked the lens port, trying to figure out what it was before tearing into her meal.

We had, after all, found the world’s southernmost tree.

I decided to explore the scenery we had trudged past in previous days as I followed the team on its primary mission. Now with the relief that we had accomplished what we had set out to do, I felt free to hunt for other creative possibilities. Some of the landscape on Cape Horn reminds me of Cornwall in England, except brighter and more saturated with color. You’d expect a pleasant stroll through these technicolor meadows, but the trees are sometimes hidden in creeks, making the ground appear flat until it’s too late. As I enjoyed the last moments of walking toward the lighthouse to catch my ride home, I plunged into the ground. My arms splayed, a gesture of surprise that saved me from dropping any further through the brush-camouflaged aperture and into the running water below my dangling feet. Grabbing at the surrounding vegetation, I crawled out gingerly. Half an hour later, with the island’s parting gift to me in my camera, I was relieved, grateful, and happy in a Zodiac riding out with the last of the team to our wooden boat, the Oveja Negra.

769,770,"Photo by Prasenjeet Yadav @prasen.yadav | This image was taken a few years ago on a steep cliff overlooking two small villages in India’s remote Spiti Valley, but it can be traced directly back to a photograph taken some 50 years ago. In 1970 pioneering wildlife biologist George Schaller snapped the first recorded photo of a snow leopard in the wild, and for nearly two decades afterward, it would remain the only known image of the so-called ghost cats that prowl the Roof of the World. 

In 2018 Prasenjeet was funded by the National Geographic Society to photograph snow leopards in his native India. By that time, camera traps had helped to bring the creatures into a somewhat better view, but they still remained highly elusive. He spent months with local researchers exploring high-altitude gorges and icy ridgelines in subfreezing temperatures, scouting for just the right spots to set up his camera traps. “I had to discover how to think like a snow leopard,” Prasenjeet says. This camera trap image was taken close to a high pasture where ibex and blue sheep, the cats' favored prey, graze. “This was one of my first pictures,” he says. “You think the cat looks startled? You should’ve seen my face when I opened the camera trap and found this image.”

Kinkajous are not super rare but are very hard to find and photograph. This one is holding onto a balsa flower filled with nectar mixed with rainwater. Silently and hardly moving so as not to frighten off the animals, Lars-Magnus Ejdeholm, my amazing assistant at the time, and I looked for them with our night-vision binoculars. If they showed up, we would be ready with cameras and large flash systems. Lars-Magnus sat in the fork of one branch, and I sat in another, both of us secured with climbing ropes. Kinkajous are sensitive to sound and movement, so we had to be up in the trees several hours before sunset. Some nights the animals turned up, other nights it was silent and dark and the assignment felt pretty hopeless. It was difficult to get any closer to the animals.

Photo Editor Kurt Mutchler and I worked with the Hotel Pennsylvania, the ""bedroom"" for all the dogs that are in New York City for the Westminster Dog Show. The approach was to set up a studio in one of the hotel's dozens of ballrooms. We roamed around the lobby and hallways to look for dogs to come and have their portraits made. Leo was a wonderful Afghan to work with. At his studio appointment, everything was going well. Leo was like a professional model, beautiful and well behaved, as are a lot of show dogs. We were only a few minutes into the shoot when the door to the ballroom-studio was opened, and Leo saw an opportunity. I will never forget how fast he was as he headed out the door. The funny thing is that every Afghan I have photographed has taken the opportunity to run. I should have known better. It is just in their nature. That worked well with the title of the story, ""How to Build a Dog,"" and the idea that dogs have been transformed from a common ancestor, the gray wolf, into what man needs: a guard dog, a hunting partner, a guide dog, or a best friend.

797,798,"Photo by @jasperdoest | The baby forest elephant trots between its parents in Lopé National Park, Gabon, along one of many paths that generations of the animals have cut through the rainforest. Elephants pass on the knowledge of what to forage, where to find the food, and, in the case of fruit, when it’s likely to be ripe. Elephants are picky eaters and they are particularly fond of saplings, young trees, and plants that first grow in newly opened gaps in the forest. They feed by breaking stems and branches, pulling down lianas, uprooting whole plants, and stripping leaves off twigs. This “elephant disturbance”—all that messy eating—is important as it results in forests having fewer, larger trees, which allows these woodlands to store more carbon, making the elephants true ecosystem engineers.

Since the first public destruction of stockpiled ivory took place in Kenya in 1989, many others have been conducted around the globe. Though controversial, these events do send a strong and highly visible message against elephant poaching and the ivory trade. With more than 100,000 elephants killed illegally a year, the future of elephants still hangs in the balance. 

Photographing the historic and record-setting burn in Kenya in April 2016 was a profoundly moving experience. The confiscated ivory at this burn represented 10,000 elephants. By destroying stockpiled ivory on such a massive scale, Kenya took a stance against the plunder of its wildlife and demonstrated its refusal to reduce these magnificent creatures to mere commodities. With the red intensity of the flames against a smoke-darkened sky, the scene felt like bearing witness to a kind of mourning ritual, releasing the spirit of these animals—a return of thousands of tusks to the earth.

The particular sheen of these marine mammals, glowing slightly from the island’s dark and weather-smoothed rocks, remains one of the most otherworldly—and thought-provoking—wildlife encounters of my photography career. 

Walruses are a keystone species, meaning they help shore up the entire biotic community they live in. When they forage on the seafloor, they churn up vast quantities of nutrient-rich sediment, providing food not just for smaller organisms but all the way up to seabirds, larger fish, seals, and even polar bears farther north. But despite their vital role in the ecosystem, they often fall low on the priority list for conservation. Read more about the walruses of Round Island in the link in bio.

Visitors here are rare, barring the occasional passing cruise ship or, at this particular time, adventurous scientists, a writer, and me—as we set off to explore the island away from the shelter of this outpost. 

In the coming days, Morales would keep us abreast of conditions by radio on an island notorious for its gales and unpredictable weather. Before setting off, I asked to take a family portrait outside during a lull in the gusts buffeting their cozy home. Admittedly I was hoping for an opportunity to catch them in the elements. They were kind and generous, willing to spend time with me as I placed them at a spot that showed the vastness and isolation of where they were. Within minutes, the winds picked up, ruffling their gracious poses to produce an image of a windswept family trying desperately to look at my camera. 

I had hoped to capture a sense of the place they were in—an isolated island at the bottom of the world. Cape Horn delivered. Later we hiked through gales and sheet rain, slipping on penguin guano before plummeting to our necks in prickly shrubs. All this in search of the world’s southernmost tree.

Eggeun is an independent guide who focuses on Indigenous tourism. We were at the Metepenagiag Heritage Park in New Brunswick, Canada, which is dedicated to preserving, showcasing, and reviving Mik’maq culture, tradition, and language. Eggeun was touching in his honesty and has a soft-spoken manner. 

“Language is the first step to preserving knowledge,” he says. “Our people have lived, fished, and hunted here since time immemorial. No one can take that away from us. In the ‘70s, when I grew up, we were beaten by our teachers when we spoke our language. Now we have Indigenous schools teaching our mother tongue to the new generation. I am a hopeful man!” 

We went foraging for wild rosebuds, and all the while Eggeun explained his deep respect for the Elders and how he looks to them for information about Mi'kmaq heritage.

Trucks, airplanes, and a snowmobile brought this male from Canada to a holding facility where he adjusted to the higher altitude and ate a high-protein diet to bolster him for hunting in unfamiliar territory. 

After decades of trapping, poisoning, and loss of habitat from human development, the lynx disappeared from the Colorado landscape by the 1970s. Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) managed a seven-year program, starting in 1999, to bring the cats back—trapping them in Canada and releasing them in Colorado. There were lots of ups and downs, but in the end, it was named a success. Today CPW estimates that there are 150 to 250 lynx living in Colorado. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service continues to list the cat as threatened in the lower 48 under the Endangered Species Act.

852,853,"Photo by @joelsartore | These two may look like domestic house cats, but they're actually a pair of Scottish wildcats that reside at Wildcat Haven in Scotland. Unlike most cats, the Scottish wildcat is a multihabitat hunter—a behavior that evolved in response to severe deforestation in its home range. This carnivore plays a key role in controlling the numbers of prey animals such as rabbits, rats, hares, and other small animals. Today, the biggest threat to the species is hybridization with feral cats.

We used the method of focus stacking to get the greatest possible depth of field for this project. Every day was a feather day. Gradually our engagement with nature and technology developed into a kind of meditation. In the end, it took us more than two years.

879,880,"Photo by @katieorlinsky | Writer Neil Shea and I have been living and breathing caribou for the past three years, and now our story, “Where Are All the Caribou?” is finally online. Check it out at the link in bio and in the December issue of National Geographic. 

The animals pictured here are part of Alaska’s Western Arctic herd, photographed deep within the Brooks Range outside the Nunamiut village of Anaktuvuk Pass. Two centuries ago, there were hundreds of thousands of caribou as far south as Maine, and in the Arctic, herds numbered close to 5 million. However, over the past 2 decades, Arctic caribou populations have been in shocking decline, dropping to roughly 2 million and falling. There hasn’t been a disappearance of so many large land mammals in such a short time since the American bison. No one knows exactly why, and it's considered to be one of the greatest wildlife mysteries on the continent.

What we do know for certain is that caribou decline is an enormous loss that threatens to put even more pressure on the fragile ecosystem of the Arctic, as well as on Indigenous communities across Alaska and Canada. They need caribou for food security, and they're also culturally and spiritually dependent on the animals, just as they have been for thousands of years.

This story was made possible because of these communities and the people who graciously shared their time and knowledge with us over the years. We thank the Nunamiut of Anaktuvuk Pass, Alaska, the Tlicho Tribe in the Northwest Territories of Canada, the Neets'aii Gwich'in community of Arctic Village, Alaska, the Inupiat village of Ambler, Alaska, and the West Moberly and Saulteau First Nations in British Columbia, Canada.

Working on this story, it’s become clear that if we want to save the caribou, we have to listen to the people who know them best.",90347,https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/399990189_315066004621255_5654558409257007898_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=yrLpN9NE-ksAX_GL4xy&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDz7JZxAwQHWnDLJrHVlqC2YpQLKyTiWcxX8QXc9sWEtg&oe=65D68C46&_nc_sid=bc0c2c

For this project we used the method of focus stacking, in which similar photos with different focal planes are blended to achieve a more profound depth of field.

The statistics can often feel disheartening and overwhelming. According to some estimates, lion numbers have dropped by 43% over the past 21 years, and many of the remaining 62 wild lion populations are now precariously small. Yet it is also true that dedicated, determined conservation efforts really can make a difference. In certain parts of Africa, there have been encouraging successes in revitalizing populations, bringing these predators back to areas where they had long been absent. What is urgently needed is the restoration of natural landscapes and the creation of interconnected wildlife corridors, so that lions can regain the critical space they need to thrive.

900,901,"Photo by @carltonward | Betty Osceola is a member of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, an airboat captain, and a powerful advocate for her Everglades home. As we mark Native American Heritage Month in November, I am grateful for her willingness to share her native lands with me and the world, including in her role as a lead character in the National Geographic film ""Path of the Panther,"" now streaming on @disneyplus. The Seminole and Miccosukee are the last Native Americans living in Florida. 

Betty Osceola advocates for better and more equitable management of Everglades water. She is asking the Army Corps of Engineers to open all the floodgates along the Tamiami Trail—a 264-mile stretch of highway between Miami and Tampa—that are currently holding back water and drowning her ancestral lands. Roads, drainage canals, and development have been blocking and diverting the flow of Everglades water for the past century. The Tamiami Trail in particular has served as a dam blocking the water. South of the road, Everglades National Park has been deprived of water that once flowed seamlessly from the north, and north of the road, Miccosukee tribal lands have been drowning under too much water artificially held back by the road and by water management practices that have prioritized flood control for densely populated areas closer to the coast. During that time, 70 percent of the tree islands that Osceola and her people have historically relied upon and which have great cultural significance for the Miccosukee, have been lost. 

Through new Everglades restoration efforts, several miles of the Tamiami Trail have been elevated into bridges to help rebalance the flow of water. But more work is needed in the multiyear restoration plan, with continued investment from the U.S. and Florida governments, in order for water to flow more naturally and for the ecosystem to more fully recover. #NativeAmericanHeritageMonth",76735,https://scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/403825211_368371472423655_5507849861787948450_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-hou1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=bJ80m_1gmOkAX_CSc-w&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfANRbCEqdXq3z4rvx4tsr28QLEq2kmDDWlTxQGBfP85xw&oe=65D774C2&_nc_sid=bc0c2c

That was the claim made by its former owner Edward Heron-Allen. In a letter entrusting the real-life gem to the Natural History Museum in London, the polymath and author called the stone “trebly accursed and stained with blood” and advised its future owners to cast it into the sea. Well, they didn’t—and to this day, the jewel retains a spooky reputation as a stone with the power to curse anyone who touches it.

They are exclusively arboreal, meaning they spend almost all of their time in the trees, trying to never let their feet touch the ground. While this might seem impossible, it is actually quite easy for gibbons thanks to their extra-long arms! This species uses those lanky forelimbs for brachiation, a form of movement in which primates swing from tree limb to tree limb using only their arms. Without forests full of tall trees in close proximity to one another, gibbons are unable to move within their home range, meaning they struggle to find the food and shelter they need to survive.

This historic hut, built by the Swedish South Polar Expedition led by Otto Nordenskjöld in 1902, stands on the shore of Snow Hill Island in Antarctica's Weddell Sea. Here, six members of the expedition spent 22 months studying the region's geology, geography, meteorology, and more. 

For those who sailed through ice-filled seas to reach this remote spot, spotting emperor penguins along the way, it was surreal to discover this desertlike landscape free of snow. What's more, the soft shale of the island preserves fossils of ancient marine animals between 65 million and 145 million years old—a reminder of Antarctica's deep geological history.

996,997,"Photo by Prasenjeet Yadav @prasen.yadav | Snow leopards evolved to live on high-elevation deserts and cliffs, and every part of their body shows signs of this adaptation, including the long, thick, furry tail. I was lucky enough to see a snow leopard chase an ibex on a cliff, and that's when I witnessed how essential—and incredible—their tails are. Snow leopards have the longest tails, proportionally, of the big cats—nearly as long as the rest of their body. The tail can be up to a yard (a meter) in length, and it helps the animal balance on steep, rocky slopes. The tail also protects against the cold, as the leopard can wrap it around its nose and legs while resting. Snow leopards patrol their territory, and one of the ways they mark their land is by spraying urine and scent on stones. In this image, a snow leopard approaches a scent-marking location in India's Spiti Valley, in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, triggering the camera trap.

In the wild, this species is found in the humid forests of West Africa, where it spends most of its time high up in the trees. Named for their large, curved beaks, most hornbills sport a casque, a hollow structure made of keratin. Casques come in a variety of sizes and colors and serve a number of functions such as attracting a mate and resonating sound to help defend territory.
